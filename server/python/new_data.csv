The Physical Side of Stress,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/physical-side-of-stress.aspx,"Frazzled by stress? Learn how it affects your emotional and physical health — and how to cope.According to the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), stress is an expression of the body’s natural instinct to protect itself. While the stress response may warn us of immediate danger, like a fast-approaching car, prolonged stress can negatively affect your physical and emotional health.“Our stress response was exquisitely honed over millions of years as a protective mechanism,” says Paul J. Rosch, MD, chairman of the American Institute of Stress (AIS) and a clinical professor of medicine at New York Medical College in Valhalla. “That was okay for our ancestors who ran into saber-toothed tigers. The tragedy is that today, it’s not that, but hundreds of things, like getting stuck in traffic jams. And our bodies respond in the same unfortunate fashion, with hypertension, strokes, and ulcers.""While men and women can react similarly in many situations, stressful or otherwise, there does seem to be some difference in how men and women react to stress. While the exact mechanisms aren't clear, and findings are conflicting, some research suggests that differences in the brain and body may make women more physically and emotionally sensitive to certain types of stress.“Women tend to react to stress differently than men,"" says Dr. Rosch. ""They don’t respond with the fight or flight response — they’re more apt to negotiate.”In previous research, psychologists have called this the ""tend and befriend"" response. This may have come about, theorize scientists, because it would have been evolutionarily adaptive for women to protect offspring rather than attack or flee from predators.The ""tend and befriend"" response, some think, may be mediated by oxytocin, an anti-stress hormone produced in women during childbirth, breast-feeding, and in both sexes during orgasm and other moments of human connection. This hormone may help women more than men, according to Rosch.Studies have shown that frequent hugs from a partner can increase levels of oxytocin — and lower levels of blood pressure — in women. Research has also found that women who have positive contact with a partner before a stressful situation show lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol and lower heart rates.RELATED: The United States of StressThe particular challenges that women face at home, in society, and at work may increase the amount of stress you experience.“Your stress may vary, but if you have stress with your work, your kids, your neighbors, and marriage all at once, that’s a big deal,” says Lori Heim, MD, past president and chair of the American Academy of Family Physicians and a physician at Scotland Memorial Hospital in Laurinburg, North Carolina. “In women, I see this in changes in menstrual patterns — nothing else is going on except a huge increase in stress, and all of a sudden, they may be losing their hair or having menstrual irregularities, and everything points to stress as a factor.”According to the National Women’s Health Information Center, the effects of stress on women’s physical and emotional health can range from headaches to stomach trouble to back pain. Specific stress effects include:Stomach Ailments Stress can make you reach for junk or comfort foods, or upset your stomach to the point that you feel like you can’t eat. Common stress-related stomach troubles include cramps, bloating, heartburn, and — according to a study published in November 2017 in the journal Frontiers in System Neuroscience — even irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which affects more women than men. Depending on how you respond, these can lead to weight loss or weight gain.Skin Reactions Stress can lead to breakouts, and even itchy rashes and hives in some people.Emotional Conditions From being in a blue or irritable mood to more serious mental issues, like depression, your emotional health suffers when there’s stress in your life.Sleep Problems Trouble falling or staying asleep is common in women affected by stress, and this is particularly counterproductive since a good night’s sleep can help ease stress.Difficulty Concentrating Stress makes it hard to focus and be effective in your responsibilities at home or work, and that can compound your problems if the stress comes from your job to begin with.Heart Trouble Stress can negatively affect the entire cardiovascular system, and while it doesn't directly cause high blood pressure, stroke, and heart attack, it can definitely contribute to them.Lowered Immune Response One of the more complicated physical reactions to stress is your body’s lessened ability to fight off disease, whether it’s a cold or a flare-up of a chronic condition.RELATED: Stress of Toxic Relationships: A Risk Factor for Heart Disease in WomenIn a survey of 3,000 people, Robert Epstein, PhD, a senior research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology in Vista, California, found that 25 percent of happiness hinges on how well you handle stress. And what was the most important stress management strategy he noticed? Planning — or anticipating what's going to stress you out — and having the tools in place to tamp down the tension. Here are some more tips for managing stress:Improve your diet. By eating well-balanced meals and skipping junk food, you can improve your physical well-being and, in turn, your emotional health.Make time for exercise. “We do know that exercise is a phenomenal way of dealing with stress and depression,” says Dr. Heim. Research shows that getting active can lift your spirits by increasing hormones and neurochemicals that can improve your mood.Find fun ways to relax. Connect with family and friends and people you enjoy being around. Rediscover favorite hobbies — research published in 2013 in the journal Frontiers in Psychiatry has linked pursuits that require focus, like crafting, drawing, or even home repairs, with stress-reducing effects. Other popular stress-busters include yoga, meditation, and tai chi.Finally, if you feel overwhelmed by stress and its effects, talk to your doctor about ways to deal with it. You may learn new techniques for managing stress on your own, or you may find that therapy with a mental health professional will better help you to get it all under control.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy."
Anger Management: How to Keep Your Temper in Check,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/managing-your-temper.aspx,"Everyone gets mad, but it's important to recognize when your anger has gotten out of control and it may be time to get professional help.It’s just a fact of life that sometimes you're going to get angry. But if your anger is excessive, you may require anger therapy to help keep your emotions in check. How do you know whether your anger is over the top and if anger management might be helpful to you?“I would say that what is really important is for a person to really know themselves,” says Elena Moser, LCSW, a therapist in private practice and clinical director of the Women’s Therapy Center in El Cerrito, Calif. “If you have tended to get in trouble, interpersonally, by impulsively expressing anger, I would say hold off on expressing anger and give yourself time to cool off or talk it over. If you are the kind of person who has held back and rarely expresses anger, then you really need to think about why you are so hesitant and to practice expressing your angry feelings.”Moser believes that expressing anger is necessary for your emotional health. But if you are having problems doing it tactfully, here are some tips to help you control your anger when it flares. Before reacting:Health and Anger ManagementFaced with conflicting news and advice about how healthy it is to express anger, many women don’t know whether to throw a plate at the wall, take a walk, or reach for a glass of wine. There are some very good reasons to learn how to manage your temper, including:Do You Need Anger Therapy?Getting angry when the situation calls for it is one thing; excessive anger is quite another. But how do you know if you need therapy for a problem with anger and aggression? Here are some signs that you may need help:“If you think you have a problem, talk to someone you trust — a friend or family member,"" says Moser. Then consider talking to a therapist. ""Therapy is a great place to come in and reflect on your personal situation,” she says.Remember, expressing anger is important and healthy, but you have a choice about how you do it.

The Amazing Benefits of Music Therapy,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/benefits-of-music-therapy.aspx,"Music has the power to help you fight stress and even manage pain, and healing music works whether you prefer heavy metal, country, opera, or something else entirely.If you haven’t created a personal favorite relaxation playlist, here's a good reason to do so: Healing music can help you fight stress, find comfort, and manage pain. And if you want an additional release through music therapy, put down your earbuds and pick up a drum! Getting your groove on enhances the effect of healing music.Healing Music: Creating Your Personal PlaylistStart by identifying music that soothes you and helps you feel comfortable. Feeling obligated to include a little classical music? Only do so if it really works for you. Whether you like Mozart, Johnny Cash, or Aerosmith, the music that most helps you relax is a highly personal decision.“What people say soothes them, soothes them, even if it’s heavy metal,” says music therapist Joanne Loewy, DA, director of the Louis Armstrong Center for Music and Medicine at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City. “The most important aspect is how it is incorporated in your life.”Healing Music: Finding a Music TherapistIf you aren’t sure what healing music suits you, Loewy recommends working with one of the 5,000 trained music therapists across the country. A music therapist can evaluate your taste and interests and make some recommendations in one visit.For example, says Loewy, a shy person might benefit from “lilting” music that can be integrated with breathing rhythms, while a more expressive person might want to include vibrations such as gongs or drumming in their music therapy. As a personal test to see which personality type you more closely fit into, Loewy says you should ask yourself what you do when you stub your toe: Grin and bear it or curse and yell!Healing Music: Grooving in LaborWomen planning vaginal childbirth are usually encouraged to bring along music that will help them relax during their labor; some women even hire musicians to provide live accompaniment.“The way that music seems to be helpful is either as a distraction, where the mind creates images, or as an integration to more actively create breaths,” says Loewy, who recommends a mix of fast and slow music to support the breathing changes of labor. “It’s also used as a release of pain during labor.”Focusing on rhythmic music, inviting a drummer into the delivery room, or even beating out a rhythm with a free hand can interrupt the cycle of pain to provide release, says Loewy.And don’t underestimate the benefit of control over your labor. Women generally recall the birth experience as positive in proportion to the amount of control they felt over their experience.Having a supportive spouse is important of course, but the feeling of empowerment women gain from being able to choose music or the position in which they labor makes a significant difference in the birth experience.Healing Music: Keeping the BeatYou don’t have to be a musician to appreciate playing a musical instrument or drum. The ability of rhythm to ease pain has been noted among patients in cancer wards and nursing homes, and it could even counter painful menstrual cramps or other daily aches.Simply joining a drum circle — an informal gathering of people for the purpose of creating rhythm — can extend the pain-fighting benefits by:Healing Music: Music Therapy and Your HealthHere are some other direct connections between music and health:So go compose that playlist, or fill up your iPod or CD changer with your favorite musical selections: This is an amazingly easy and entertaining way to combat stress and boost your overall sense of well-being.Learn more in the Everyday Health Women's Health Center.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.A new study found that taking hormonal contraceptives may have a small protective effect on severe cases of asthma in reproductive-age women.Lack of maternity care providers and no guaranteed maternity leave were cited as potential causes.How women value sex as they age, and why low-libido treatments are not available, were among the themes explored at the annual menopause meeting.The Supreme Court ruled that employers can refuse to offer birth control coverage as mandated by the Affordable Care Act if they have religious or moral...Count the Kicks, a prevention program, may spare some families from late pregnancy loss.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy."

Help for Postpartum Depression,https://www.everydayhealth.com/postpartum-depression/guide/,"An estimated 1 in 9 new mothers may experience postpartum depression. Here’s how to recognize the symptoms and get the right treatment.While every case of postpartum depression may result from a different combination of factors, researchers believe that, in general, hormones, neurochemistry, and life circumstances explain why an estimated 1 in 9 women in the United States experience this mental health disorder, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And those numbers may be even higher — as noted in an article published in April 2017 in Maternal Child and Health Journal, experts believe that postpartum depression is often underreported.The risk of postpartum depression is higher among people who have a history of mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder. A study published in February 2017 in the journal Depression and Anxiety found that the risk was more than 20 times higher for women with a history of depression. Having one episode of postpartum depression can also increase your chances of having another.But postpartum depression isn’t permanent: With time and help, both medical and otherwise, you can return to normal routines.Pregnancy and birth are intensely emotional events. These milestones can bring joy, but they can also present challenges that make you feel sad, tired, and anxious. These feelings are normal and, in fact, have a name: the baby blues.Up to 80 percent of mothers feel some degree of unhappiness, worry, and fatigue after giving birth, according to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). But while the baby blues are somewhat mild, rarely last beyond a week or two, and go away on their own, postpartum depression symptoms are extreme and can persist for months.“If symptoms go beyond a two-week period, and the mother is still experiencing problems, that will usually lead to a diagnosis of postpartum depression,” says Diane Young, MD, a staff physician in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the Cleveland Clinic who is based at the Willoughby Hills Family Health Center in Ohio.The baby blues may lead to postpartum depression if there are past or current stresses that make you feel that you lack support and stability. Your relationship with your spouse or partner may be difficult, or your finances may be unstable; perhaps your pregnancy or delivery were hard, or you have a high-need newborn. Maybe you lost a parent while you were pregnant, are a very young mother, or experienced trauma as a child.RELATED: How to Cope With Caregiver DepressionLife circumstances might also make you more vulnerable to the hormonal disruptions that occur after birth. During pregnancy, estrogen and progesterone levels increase to fortify both the uterus and the placenta. But delivery alters the levels of those and other hormones.“After giving birth, hormone concentrations drop by 100 fold within a matter of days,” says Katherine Wisner, MD, director of the Asher Center for the Study and Treatment of Depressive Disorders at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago. The sudden disruption in hormone levels may create disturbances in mood, particularly in women who have prior histories of depression or anxiety.Periods of hormonal fluctuation, such as menstrual cycles and perimenopause, are associated with major depressive episodes, says Dr. Wisner. It could be that the fluctuations that occur during and after pregnancy may affect certain neurotransmitters or affect brain function in other ways. “This massive drop in hormones, along with the initiation of breastfeeding, disrupted sleep, and adapting to motherhood all contribute to the risk for developing depression,” she adds.There is also research suggesting that both pregestational and gestational diabetes may increase the risk of postpartum depression.RELATED: First Ever Guidelines Address Depression in Midlife WomenYes, men can also suffer mood disorders because of a new baby. A report in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 10 percent of men showed signs of depression from the first trimester of a partner’s pregnancy through six months after the child was born, with the number jumping to 26 percent during the three- to six-month period after birth.A study in the journal Pediatrics, which looked at more than 1,700 fathers with 1-year-old children, found that depression had a negative effect on parenting: Depressed dads were more likely to spank their children and less likely to read to them.In rare cases — involving 1 or 2 in 1,000 births, according to the American Psychiatric Association — a new mother will experience postpartum psychosis. The symptoms are more severe than in postpartum depression, and they come on rapidly, usually within the first few days of giving birth.Those suffering from postpartum psychosis may have bizarre, grandiose thoughts, or delusions, and their moods may swing from one extreme to another. They may also hallucinate — hearing voices or seeing things that aren’t there — and may have recurring thoughts of harming themselves or their baby.In some cases of postpartum psychosis, there may be a previous history of mental illness, such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or schizoaffective disorder.If you notice any of these changes in someone you love or are close to, it’s important to seek help right away so both mother and child remain safe.RELATED: 9 Different Types of DepressionAny parent can develop postpartum depression, but the following factors may increase risk, according to the NIMH, which emphasizes that the condition can affect any woman regardless of age, race, ethnicity, or economic status:Symptoms of postpartum depression vary from person to person. According to the Mayo Clinic, these usually develop within the first few weeks after giving birth but may begin earlier (during pregnancy, say) or later (up to a year after birth). They may include:RELATED: Detecting and Diagnosing Depression: It Can Look Different in Men and Women and in Teenagers, TooYour doctor or midwife may detect signs that you are at risk for postpartum depression during prenatal visits or during the typical six-week appointment after your baby is born. Your baby’s doctor may also diagnose postpartum depression, with the American Academy of Pediatrics now recommending that pediatricians screen mothers at the one-, two-, four-, and six-month well-child visits.Often with postpartum depression, signs of depression emerge during pregnancy, so if you do notice any of the above symptoms before you deliver, tell your healthcare provider.Regardless of the extent of your symptoms, it’s important to get proper treatment during this important time in your life and the life of your baby. One or more treatment options may help, according to the Office on Women’s Health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services:Talk Therapy A therapist, psychologist, or social worker can teach you strategies to change how depression makes you feel, think, and behave.Medicine There are a number of different types of drugs to treat postpartum depression, starting with antidepressants. Your healthcare provider can prescribe one that is safe to take while breastfeeding. Note that these medicines may take several weeks to become effective.In March 2019, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Zulresso (brexanolone) as the first medication specifically for postpartum depression. It is administered through an IV line continuously for two-and-a-half days (60 hours). It may not be safe to take while pregnant or breastfeeding.In 2019, the FDA also approved the nasal spray Spravato (esketamine) for treatment-resistant depression in adults; derived from ketamine, a widely used anesthetic, it is only administered at certified treatment centers. The drug works very quickly, usually within hours. It is not safe to take while pregnant or breastfeeding.Electroconvulsive Therapy Known as ECT, electroconvulsive therapy can help in some cases of extreme depression. Small electrical currents are passed through the brain, intentionally triggering a brief seizure and altering brain chemistry.The following strategies will help you during treatment, according to the Mayo Clinic:Make healthy lifestyle choices. It’s important for people who have postpartum depression to take time to do things like eating healthy meals, exercising, and getting enough sleep.Practice self-care. Enlist a partner to watch the baby or hire a sitter, then get out of the house and do something fun.Set realistic expectations. Treatment can help, but it may take some time before you feel like yourself again. In the meantime, don’t pressure yourself to check off everything on your to-do list.Say yes to caregiving help. Take people up on their offers to help. Your friends and family members can help around the house, watch the baby so you can sleep, run errands for you, or be there to listen when you need to talk.Avoid isolation. Talk with your partner, friends, or family about how you’re feeling. You may want to join a support group with other mothers who’ve experienced postpartum depression and can share experiences and coping skills.Additional reporting by Pamela Kaufman.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.In this episode of Boxed In, psychiatrist and Everyday Health Medical Editor in Chief Patrice Harris, MD, discusses how disparities within the healthcare...There is no health without mental health, says Dr. Harris, Everyday Health's new medical editor in chief.Brian Fallon, MD, the director of the Center for Neuroinflammatory Disorders and Biobehavioral Medicine at Columbia University, discusses the impact of...First assess whether your drinking habit is healthy.

An Empty Nest Opens New Doors,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/empty-nest-opens-new-doors.aspx,"While some parents may experience sadness and depression when their children grow up and move out, many more enjoy the positive changes in parenting that follow.The phrase ""empty nest syndrome"" brings to mind images of sad women wringing their hands and trying to ignore the empty bedroom down the hall. While some parents may experience sadness and even depression when a child leaves home, many more enjoy the positive changes in parenting that come with a so-called empty nest.There is an upside to watching your children leave home, says Christine M. Proulx, PhD, assistant professor in the department of human development and family studies at the University of Missouri in Columbia. Proulx and her research team have conducted interviews with couples whose oldest child recently left the home and has found that empty nest benefits include:Other benefits of having fewer, if any, children to care for every day include:Empty Nest: Mixed EmotionsAs with all your parenting experiences, you may find the empty nest stirs a range of emotions, from pleased and proud to sad and worried. That’s normal, says Proulx.“Parents may feel excitement about their children’s new adventures, sadness about not seeing their child as often or about letting go, worry or concern about their child — hoping they lock the door at night, that they make good decisions — pleasure at watching their child become more like an adult and being able to interact with them in a more adult-like manner,” she says.Proulx’s research team interviewed both mothers and fathers about their view of the transition to an empty nest. Overall, she says, the feedback was positive, contrary to the stereotype many of us have.“For many parents, it was clear they enjoyed interacting with their child in a more adult-to-adult or peer-to-peer manner, or even in more of a mentoring rather than an active parenting manner,” she says. “Many parents enjoyed watching their child’s increased maturity and independence. I think many parents enjoyed the way they could talk with their child as the child’s maturity increased.""Proulx’s study is one of the few to include fathers, who can be just as affected by the empty nest as mothers. Talking to both parents yielded a more complete picture of the changing parenting relationship, she says. For example, in one case, the mother said she was saddened by the fact that she and her daughter were speaking less frequently, but the father reported pleasure over the fact that his daughter was turning more often to him for advice. On the whole, she says, fathers and mothers reported similar feelings about the situation.If the Empty Nest Brings You DownEven though there are opportunities to feel positive about your changing parenting roles, you may, indeed, feel sadness and grief over the change. You don't have to go through these hard times alone.“I do think parents who are struggling would find it helpful to talk to other parents who are going through, or have gone through, this transition. Every family will experience it differently, but there’s a lot of common ground,” Proulx says.If you cannot shake your feelings of sadness or you find it hard to get motivated and excited about your own life despite the empty nest, it may be time to talk to a psychotherapist who has experience with these issues.Learn more in the Everyday Health Women's Health Center.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.A new study found that taking hormonal contraceptives may have a small protective effect on severe cases of asthma in reproductive-age women.Lack of maternity care providers and no guaranteed maternity leave were cited as potential causes.How women value sex as they age, and why low-libido treatments are not available, were among the themes explored at the annual menopause meeting.The Supreme Court ruled that employers can refuse to offer birth control coverage as mandated by the Affordable Care Act if they have religious or moral...Count the Kicks, a prevention program, may spare some families from late pregnancy loss.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy."
Common Mental Health Issues in Women,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/mental-health-issues-in-women.aspx,"Certain mental health disorders are more prevalent in women. Learn the reasons behind these gender differences and how you can protect your emotional well-being.If you are a woman experiencing depression, an anxiety disorder, or another mental health condition, you are not alone.According to a recent survey by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 29 million American women, or about 23 percent of the female population, have experienced a diagnosable mental health-related disorder in the last year alone. And those are just the known instances.Experts say that millions of other cases may go unreported — and untreated.Mental Health: Women’s Health IssuesSome mental health conditions occur more often in women and can play a significant role in the state of a woman's overall health.While men experience higher rates of autism, early onset schizophrenia, antisocial personality disorder, and alcoholism, mental health conditions more common in women include:Mental Health: Women’s Symptoms Are Also DifferentEven when men and women share a common mental health diagnosis, the symptoms, and subsequently the treatment, can be different.For example, a man who is depressed is likely to report job-related problems, while a woman is more likely to report physical issues, like fatigue or appetite and sleep disturbances. Unlike their depressed male counterparts, women tend to develop problems with alcohol abuse within a few years of the onset of depression. Women are more likely to use religious and emotional outlets to offset the symptoms of depression compared to men, who often find relief through sports and other hobbies.Women with schizophrenia more often experience depression and thought impairment, while men with schizophrenia are more likely to become apathetic and socially isolated. Women with schizophrenia typically respond faster to antipsychotic medication and need less personal care. Schizophrenic women also report more mood symptoms, which can complicate the diagnostic process and may require a prescription for mood stabilizers in addition to anti-psychotic medications.Mental Health: Why the Gender Differences?What goes on in the female brain and body to differentiate these responses to mental illness? The answers may lie in:Girls tend to become dissatisfied with their bodies at puberty, a reaction that is linked to depression. Girls are also sexually abused more often than boys, and one in five women will experience rape or attempted rape, which can lead to depression and panic disorder.Mental Health: Ongoing ResearchWhile distinctions between men and women weren't always clearly made in mental health research, in recent years government mandates have encouraged federal agencies such as the National Institutes of Health to respond to the need for mental health research specific to women. Private organizations are also responding to the need to research men’s and women’s health issues separately.For example, researchers at the Women’s Health Research Center at Yale University in New Haven, Conn., are studying many issues related to women's mental health, including:As more research comes to light and there is greater understanding of women’s mental health issues, experts are hopeful that targeted treatments will bring better results and more positive outcomes for women with mental health conditions.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.A new study found that taking hormonal contraceptives may have a small protective effect on severe cases of asthma in reproductive-age women.Lack of maternity care providers and no guaranteed maternity leave were cited as potential causes.How women value sex as they age, and why low-libido treatments are not available, were among the themes explored at the annual menopause meeting.The Supreme Court ruled that employers can refuse to offer birth control coverage as mandated by the Affordable Care Act if they have religious or moral...Count the Kicks, a prevention program, may spare some families from late pregnancy loss.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy."
Facing an Eating Disorder as an Adult,https://www.everydayhealth.com/eating-disorders/guide/,"Are you just watching your weight, or do you have an eating disorder?Watching what you eat, like most things, is good for you in moderation. To eat nutritious foods and feel comfortable in your body is certainly a good goal. But when you focus excessively on what you eat, when you eat, and how much you eat to the point where it impinges on your life and impairs your ability to function, you may have an eating disorder.How can you know if your concern about your diet and your body’s shape is veering toward — or may already be — an eating disorder? You can’t just look in a mirror. Despite what many people think, you don’t have to be female or skinny — or fat — to have an eating disorder. You don’t even have to look as though anything is wrong. “Weight can be an indicator of an eating disorder, but it certainly isn’t the only one,” says Ilene Fishman, a licensed clinical social worker in New York City and Montclair, New Jersey, who spent a decade during her adolescence battling — and eventually recovering from — her own severe anorexia.The stereotype pinning eating disorders to young, white, well-to-do females doesn’t always match up with reality. “Eating disorders are found across all age groups, social classes, gender, sizes, education levels, races, and ethnicities,” says Tomoko Udo, PhD, the coauthor of a large-scale study on the prevalence of eating disorders published in the April 16, 2018, issue of the journal Biological Psychiatry: A Journal of Psychiatric Neuroscience and Therapeutics. (1) Indeed, stereotypes about who is affected by eating disorders can be a real barrier in getting help for the people who don’t fit those stereotypes, says Dr. Udo.Because eating disorders aren’t always obvious, they’re far more common than many of us realize. At some point in their lives, at least 30 million Americans (even some 10 million boys and men) will experience an eating disorder. (2)The most common eating disorders that affect both genders are:Eating disorders are complex illnesses caused by an interaction of genetic, biological, behavioral, psychological, and social factors, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. (4)Having a parent or sibling with an eating disorder, for example, may predispose a person to develop one. So, too, might having an anxiety or depressive disorder, or experiencing a trauma, such as sexual abuse. (5) Even being bullied in childhood can dramatically increase one’s risk. (6)We also live in a culture that has, historically, valued waist size over accomplishments. Movies, television shows, and fashion magazines have perpetuated this value system by featuring unhealthy and unrealistic bodies, thus contributing to eating disorders.But that has started to change in recent years. More and more celebrities are stepping forward to reveal the toll that the culture of thinness has taken on them, helping to increase awareness about eating disorders and reduce the stigma.Among them are:Healthcare providers often overlook the signs of an eating disorder, and many even say things that could make the disorder worse. Not asking a patient who has lost a significant amount weight about his or her eating habits, and instead praising them for finally getting their weight under control, is one common scenario, says Nanci Pradas, PhD, a psychotherapist in private practice in Bedford, Massachusetts. Many doctors also prescribe medication for depression without considering how a patient’s mental state might be affecting their eating behavior.The reason eating disorders fall through the cracks in doctor’s offices so easily is simple: Few doctors receive in-depth training in identifying and treating eating disorders, even in family medicine and psychiatric residency programs, according to a national survey published in the May 2015 issue of the International Journal of Eating Disorders (10)You might want to consider consulting an expert if you notice any of these red flags in yourself or a friend or family member:In a word, very. Although many people in the grip of an eating disorder appear very high functioning on the outside, excelling at work and at home, inside, their bodies are in crisis. Some eventually fully recover. Others cycle through periods of recovery and relapse. And some become chronically ill or die. Anorexia is especially deadly. Research published in the July 2011 issue of the journal Archives of General Psychiatry shows it is the deadliest of all psychiatric illnesses, far surpassing schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. (11) An estimated 20 percent of those who develop it eventually die from medical complications such as irregular or very low heartbeat (arrhythmia), sudden cardiac arrest, severe liver disease, or suicide.Even those who survive may face serious health issues, including but not limited to:People with anorexia may think they’re overweight when they aren’t.

People with bulimia eat uncontrollably and then get rid of the extra calories by “purging”: vomiting, fasting, using laxatives, taking certain medications, and exercising.While it may seem like an effective way to lose weight, this bingeing and purging cycle usually doesn’t work. Many people with bulimia gain weight, instead of shedding unwanted pounds.If bulimia isn’t treated, it can lead to serious consequences, including heart and kidney problems. Some even die from complications of the disorder.Certain therapies and medications are available to help people with bulimia recover successfully.RELATED: Icky Mouth Mysteries SolvedRead More About BulimiaBinge-eating disorder is the most common eating disorder of all, and it's often the hardest to detect because the signs — fluctuations in weight and gastrointestinal complaints — are so common in the general population. People who have this disorder have episodes in which they consume larger amounts of food than normal, often to the point of discomfort, in short amounts of time. They often do this in secret, because of the shame they feel about their behavior. Unlike those who suffer from bulimia, people with this disorder do not purge afterward.RELATED: What It Feels Like to Have Binge-Eating DisorderRead More About Binge-Eating DisorderOrthorexia is a term that was coined in 1988 to describe people who become so obsessed with healthful eating that they actually damage their health. There is no formal diagnostic criteria for this eating disorder, nor is it formally recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). Warning signs include compulsively checking ingredient lists and nutritional labels, distress when healthy foods are not available, and a high degree of interest in what others are eating.RELATED: What Is Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)?Read More About OrthorexiaDiabulimia is a term created by the media for people with type 1 diabetes who manipulate the dose of insulin prescribed to manage their blood sugar in order to lose weight. In the DSM-5, it is classified as a purging behavior, which puts it in the category of bulimia. People with diabetes are at increased risk of developing an eating disorder because their condition requires them to focus on food, labels, and weight — just as people with eating disorders do.RELATED: 8 Essentials to Help You Manage Insulin TherapyRead More About DiabulimiaConcerned?

Treating PMS May Be Vital to Your Well-Being,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/pms-treatment-for-your-well-being.aspx,"If you're one of the millions of women affected by premenstrual syndrome, you should know that there are many treatments to help alleviate physical and emotional ups and downs.According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, at least 85 percent of women experience at least one symptom of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), which is the term used to describe the physical and emotional changes that occur in the days before a woman’s period. Experts don’t know for certain what causes these changes, but recent research from Sweden suggests that they may be explained by an increased sensitivity to the hormone allopregnanolone. Basically, women who report symptoms of PMS — especially psychological symptoms — have an altered neurotransmitter that makes them less able to adapt to variations in hormone levels.The good news is that because PMS is such a well-known women’s health issue, there are many options available to you, from nutritional supplements to psychotherapy, that can help treat the symptoms (if not the cause).“We see many women who talk about PMS,” says Elena Moser, LCSW, private practice therapist and clinical director of the Women’s Therapy Center in El Cerrito, Calif. “If a woman has PMS, often it creates a lot stress on a pretty regular basis, once a month.”Some of the signs that PMS may be affecting your emotional health include the regular occurrence of a combination of these symptoms at the same point in your monthly menstrual cycle:But for about five percent of women, PMS symptoms are so severe that they are diagnosed as premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a more serious form of PMS. Women with PMDD find that the disorder not only interferes with their own health, but it also causes serious problems in their relationships at home and at work.PMS Treatment: What WorksThe first step to finding out if you need PMS treatment — whether for emotional or physical symptoms — is keeping a log of your symptoms, from the obvious physical ones to the sometimes less obvious emotional ones. Do this for at least two months so your doctor can get a clear picture of the pattern of symptoms you're experiencing.There are many treatment options available for PMS. Some require a prescription, others don’t. For best results, discuss all the options you’re considering with your doctor:Fish oil.PMS Treatment: What Doesn’t WorkTo ease PMS symptoms, experts suggest cutting back on:With so many options available for PMS treatment, by working with your doctor, you should be able to find a combination that lessens or even eliminates troubling physical and emotional symptoms.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.A new study found that taking hormonal contraceptives may have a small protective effect on severe cases of asthma in reproductive-age women.Lack of maternity care providers and no guaranteed maternity leave were cited as potential causes.How women value sex as they age, and why low-libido treatments are not available, were among the themes explored at the annual menopause meeting.The Supreme Court ruled that employers can refuse to offer birth control coverage as mandated by the Affordable Care Act if they have religious or moral...Count the Kicks, a prevention program, may spare some families from late pregnancy loss.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy."
Making the Most of Midlife,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/making-the-most-of-midlife.aspx,"Many factors can come together to make you feel like you're heading for a midlife crisis, and certain women's health issues complicate the emotional picture.Somewhere between the ages of 40 and 60 you may hit what is commonly termed a ""midlife crisis."" This can be a big turning point in your life related in part to the normal changes that take place for all women, or it may pass with little fanfare.“I think there is something to the idea that women and men both are working so hard to move their lives along in their 20s and 30s and 40s that, whatever the [midlife] catalyst is, something comes along and the person says, this is my life, this is it,” says Elena Moser, LCSW, a therapist in private practice and clinical director of the Women’s Therapy Center in El Cerrito, Calif. That realization can spur growth … or it can trigger anxiety and depression as a response to stressful events.Common stressful life issues that seem to trigger a midlife crisis include:For many, says Moser, a midlife crisis may simply result from the realization that you are 50 and haven’t yet written that novel or achieved another long-held dream.As women reach middle age, they begin to experience some expected bodily changes, like menopause, but may also suddenly face new, serious medical issues. A diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, cancer, or osteoporosis, are just a few conditions that are more common to women during and after midlife. These women’s health concerns can trigger the depression and anxiety that characterizes a midlife crisis.Although researchers are still looking into whether and how the emotions accompanying a midlife crisis can affect your physical health, it is known that some women develop (or revisit) an eating disorder as they try to cope with midlife issues.“Not all women experience a midlife crisis,” says Moser. “I think the idea that all women go through a midlife crisis is probably rooted in the stereotype of women being mothers and then, with children going away from home, being left with ‘nothing to do.’”The reality is that many women adjust to the empty nest and report feeling good about watching their children mature and about having the chance to redefining their own peer-to-peer friendships. Moser points out that since so many women now work outside the home throughout their adult lives, having children leave home is not quite as disruptive today as it was when women had little else going on in their lives.A midlife crisis may sneak up on you.“For different people, that [midlife crisis] can spiral into a depression or states of anxiety or intense questioning or reflection,” says Moser.Sometimes a sign of a midlife crisis is doing something completely out of character, and wanting to do it with a great sense of urgency, such as:Moser cautions that wanting to change your life isn’t necessarily a bad thing: Thoughtful changes can lead to growth. But reckless changes may lead to poor decisions that cause heartache later, so you should recognize the possibility that your desires are related to your temporary emotional state.“I think a good way to get through a midlife crisis is to really think about what you want for your life and talk about it with somebody,” says Moser.Therapy can be very beneficial at this point. “The goal of therapy is to have a conversation with another person, with the two of you putting your heads together to talk about your life,” says Moser, who also suggests joining a support group for women facing midlife issues.With some individual guidance and the company of other women, chances are you will sail gracefully through midlife, and perhaps even find renewed meaning and purpose for the next chapters of your life.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.A new study found that taking hormonal contraceptives may have a small protective effect on severe cases of asthma in reproductive-age women.Lack of maternity care providers and no guaranteed maternity leave were cited as potential causes.How women value sex as they age, and why low-libido treatments are not available, were among the themes explored at the annual menopause meeting.The Supreme Court ruled that employers can refuse to offer birth control coverage as mandated by the Affordable Care Act if they have religious or moral...Count the Kicks, a prevention program, may spare some families from late pregnancy loss.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy."
The Emotional Side of Infertility,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/emotional-side-of-infertility.aspx,"Being diagnosed with endometriosis — and the fertility problems that often come with it — can bring on a rollercoaster of emotions. Shock, denial, anger, and depression are common. If these feelings are affecting you, try these smart strategies to help you cope.If you’re ready to start a family, having endometriosis may make it more difficult. A review published in December 2012 in Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America indicates that as many as 30 to 50 percent of women with endometriosis struggle with infertility. The challenges are emotional as well as physical.“If a woman has been diagnosed with endometriosis, which results in secondary infertility, and she has decided that she wants to start a family — then she’s experiencing distress from two different angles,” explains reproductive endocrinologist Judi Chervenak, MD, associate clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology in women’s health at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City.“The first [stressor] is that she has a medical condition, which is resulting in infertility and which could also be causing her physical distress,” Dr. Chervenak says. “But she also is experiencing [emotional] distress, in that her physical condition is limiting her ability for that which she so desires.”From the wish to have a baby to the diagnosis of reproductive problems and the often lengthy process of trying to conceive, the experience of infertility can cause anger, confusion, depression, a sense of helplessness, and frustration.With infertility “you experience loss — the loss of the image you have of yourself as a healthy person, as a fertile person,” explains Mary Lou Ballweg, co-founder and executive director of the Endometriosis Association. “It’s like losing a dream.”Shannon Carney, a 36 year-old from Milwaukee, experienced painful periods for years before she was diagnosed with endometriosis at age 32. “I had symptoms back as far as I can remember,” says Carney. She also had trouble conceiving. Around the time she was getting advice on endometriosis treatment options, she unexpectedly became pregnant. But the intense joy she felt turned into “the worst, devastating grief” when she had a miscarriage at eight weeks.“How did I cope?” she asks out loud, “through self-educating myself, which then led me to other women who had similar experiences. Everyone has their own road map. It’s too late for me — I can’t go back and change things. I can’t go back to get the diagnosis 10 years earlier, when I was healthier and could have tried for a baby then. Now I want to spread education and awareness about endometriosis to as many women as I can,” says Carney, who is the education program coordinator for the Endometriosis Association.If a jumble of painful emotions is affecting you, take heart: there are resources you can turn to. Start with these tips:The most important thing, says Ballweg, is to make getting well — not just getting pregnant — your focus. Things have changed over the last few years, she says. “It used to be, let’s just get her pregnant. Now it’s, ‘first, let’s get you well.’” And there’s so much that can be done to have that happen, she says.When you’re in a lot of pain, and your life is upside down, it can help to learn about the disease, learn about the toxicities — learn about it all. “There’s so much to it, so much to learn and do about first getting well,” she says.Additional reporting by Andrea PeirceBy subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.An expert answers frequently asked questions from women with endo&nbsp;Through advocacy and sharing vulnerable images of her ‘endo belly,’ Aronow wants other women to feel less alone.Facing the disease as a couple helped Kari and Ryan Anderson persevere and start a family.An open, honest, and raw conversation about what life with endo is really likeLiving with a medical mystery is not nearly as entertaining as watching other patients stump doctors on TV.

Why Women Cheat,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/why-women-cheat.aspx,"Men's penchant for infidelity may attract much of the attention when it comes to cheating, but women aren't immune. Understand why women cheat, why men cheat, and how couples can work to keep infidelity out of a relationship.When it comes to infidelity, there are a number of myths and misconceptions. First of all, infidelity isn't limited to sex or physical contact. And second, men aren't the only ones who cheat.Women also seek comfort and satisfaction (in and out of the bedroom) outside of their marriages, and almost as frequently as men do, says Sarah Cook Ruggera, MFT, a marriage and family therapist in San Diego. It's estimated that the number of men who cheat on their wives is up to 60 percent. But as many as 55 percent of women also cheat, says Ruggera, a number that's climbing and today is likely on a par with men's statistics.It's also important to clarify that you don't have to have sex to commit infidelity. Infidelity can be ""some kind of inappropriate intimacy outside their relationship, be it emotional or physical,"" explains Ruggera. ""Most affairs are not always about sex.""Cyber-CheatingFor instance, cyber affairs are allowing computers to invade the bedroom in more ways than one. “Cheating” can occur online, without ever having sex or even seeing the other person, but it's certainly an act of unfaithfulness. A recent study found that while a man didn't consider an online affair to be cheating because there was no physical contact, his wife disagreed. During the course of therapy to help repair the marriage, other problems gnawing away at the couple before the online affair surfaced, such as a lack of communication, being unhappy with their sex life, and simply feeling bored. But the study also indicated that people may cheat (at least online) without those marital problems.Something Is MissingWhy are so many men and women willing to break their marriage vows? Some women who cheat have some type of mental illness or personality disorder. But primarily why women cheat is because there is an emotional disconnect or feeling of neglect, says Ruggera. ""In many cases of infidelity, it is about feeling emotionally connected to someone.""Women and men cheat because they're simply missing something in their relationship. When women start to feel disconnected and distant, loneliness and depression can set in. Eventually, they may look outside their relationship for someone who can meet their emotional and physical needs and ease their loneliness.Relationship problems may trigger infidelity and explain why women cheat. The reasons may include:Women Who Cheat: Problems WithinLow self-esteem can be another reason why women cheat. ""Gaining attention from men can boost their self-confidence and self-esteem,"" says Ruggera. ""Compliments, phone calls, flowers, and notes from another man are flattering and make a woman feel more attractive and wanted.""Another reason why women — and men — cheat is that they do what they know. If they saw infidelity in their parents' relationship, both men and women may follow those patterns in their own lives.Women vs. MenWomen who cheat do so for many of the same reasons that men do — attraction issues, unsatisfying sex life, unhappy relationship, feelings of neglect, looking for an ego boost, and a disconnect in the marriage.""Women are not that different from men when it comes to cheating, except that they are more apt to fall in love with their new partner,"" says Ruggera. The reason is hormonal — oxytocin, a hormone, stimulates the brain to give a woman that rush from being in love.Perhaps because of that, women are also more likely to care about the emotional aspects of infidelity when their partners cheat. In a recent study published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences, female victims of cheating asked about sex in just 29 percent of cases but about love in 71 percent of cases, compared with 57 percent and 43 percent of cases, respectively, for men.Working on IntimacyIf you want to protect your relationship from the temptation (and destruction) of infidelity, know that it needs to be nurtured and cared for — water it, feed it, give it love and sunlight to watch it grow and blossom.Related: Are You Having a Midlife Crisis?""The most effective way to keep a relationship or marriage healthy is to work on it every day and evaluate it on a regular basis,"" suggests Ruggera, adding that if a couple makes a concentrated effort to make a relationship a priority, enjoy time together, and work on clear communication, they can avoid feeling like they need someone else to make them happy.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.A new study found that taking hormonal contraceptives may have a small protective effect on severe cases of asthma in reproductive-age women.Lack of maternity care providers and no guaranteed maternity leave were cited as potential causes.How women value sex as they age, and why low-libido treatments are not available, were among the themes explored at the annual menopause meeting.The Supreme Court ruled that employers can refuse to offer birth control coverage as mandated by the Affordable Care Act if they have religious or moral...Count the Kicks, a prevention program, may spare some families from late pregnancy loss.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy."
Build a Better Body Image in Five Easy Steps,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/build-a-better-body-image-in-five-easy-steps.aspx,"A self-image makeover might be a good to-do item on your agenda. Here's how to love your body, flaws and all.The National Eating Disorders Association has a message: Be comfortable in your genes. “I think that’s a great slogan because it emphasizes that so much of our body shape is attributed to genetics and we tend forget that,” says Sari Fine Shepphird, PhD, a Los Angeles clinical psychologist who specializes in eating disorders, body image, and sport and performance psychology.When we look in the mirror, most of us focus more on what we don’t like about our shape, whether that’s our big thighs or small breasts. “Over time, we come to see bodies as ornamental rather than instrumental,” Dr. Shepphird says. “We see our bodies as something to be looked at rather than used and appreciated.”We hold ourselves up to the women we see on in magazines and on television, movies, and billboards, and develop a negative self-image when we can’t compare. The media portrays the ideal woman as the supermodel, making it harder for us to appreciate a body that isn’t as perfect, Shepphird says. So we concentrate our efforts on weight loss and link our body image to success on the scale.Building a Better Self-ImageYou can learn to embrace your body just as you are. Here’s how:Think positive. If you look in the mirror and berate yourself, you will have a negative self-image. Turn your negatives into positives. Instead of saying, “I’m overweight,” pride yourself on having achieved some small weight loss. Rather than concentrating on having to lose another 25 pounds, be excited that you’ve lost three pounds and are off to a great start. Know that you can achieve additional weight loss in time. If you don’t like your flabby arms, focus instead on how you can and will improve them with exercise. Think of solutions (the positive) rather than problems (the negative.)Make a “nice” list. Write down 10 things you like about yourself. Every day, say five of them to yourself when you wake up, Shepphird suggests. If you switch it up, you’ll pay more attention to what you’re saying and not just do it by rote. Make sure that at least some of the items on your list aren’t related to your appearance.Don’t compare yourself to others. “There’s always going to be someone who makes us feel insecure or less attractive,” notes Shepphird. “Constantly comparing ourselves to others makes us feel like we’re not measuring up. Quit the comparisons and you’ll feel better about yourself in the long run.”Be kind to yourself. You’re probably much harsher on yourself than you are on your family and friends. If you treat yourself like you do your friends and family, you’ll like yourself better. “Be gentle and flexible with yourself,” Shepphird says. “It’s okay to have an occasional treat.” Keep active and listen to what your body is telling you.Dress your best. Don’t wear clothes that are oversized to hide your weight; they often draw more attention to your size, as do clothes that are too tight. Wear what you’re most comfortable in and what’s best for your body type. If you feel that you look good in what you are wearing, you will feel better about yourself.With a little attitude adjustment, you can boost your self-image and celebrate your unique traits.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.A new study found that taking hormonal contraceptives may have a small protective effect on severe cases of asthma in reproductive-age women.Lack of maternity care providers and no guaranteed maternity leave were cited as potential causes.How women value sex as they age, and why low-libido treatments are not available, were among the themes explored at the annual menopause meeting.The Supreme Court ruled that employers can refuse to offer birth control coverage as mandated by the Affordable Care Act if they have religious or moral...Count the Kicks, a prevention program, may spare some families from late pregnancy loss.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy."
Oprah's Aha! Health Moments,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/0519/oprah-aha-health-moments.aspx,"During her 25 years as host of 'The Oprah Winfrey Show,' the media mogul has had a massive impact on pop culture, but getting Americans to talk (and care) about their health has been one of her most important — and underrated — influences.For 25 years, millions of viewers around the world have tuned in day after day to see what the queen of talk has to say. Whether Oprah was gifting her audience in those squeal-inducing “Oprah’s Favorite Things” episodes, introducing the latest must-read novel in her enormously influential book club, or conducting unforgettable interviews with a couch-jumping Tom Cruise or then-president hopeful Barack Obama, there’s no questioning the immense influence Oprah has had on her viewers and popular culture at large.The “Oprah Effect” on product sales has been well-documented: Chicago-based Garrett Popcorn had a 100 percent increase in sales during the month it was featured on her show. Spanx sold 50,000 products within three months of its Oprah appearance, according to CNBC.But the media mogul may have had an equally important impact on women’s health. From raising awareness of child abuse to bringing us the wisdom and advice of Dr. Phil and Dr. Oz, Oprah has helped change the way Americans think and talk about their health. “She started a very important conversation that was lacking in this country, which was how our health affects every aspect of our lives,” explains Mehmet Oz, MD, cardiothoracic surgeon and host of The Dr Oz Show, especially the integral connection between health and emotional well-being. Here’s a look back at the most influential moments of the last quarter century of The Oprah Winfrey Show.Oprah Reveals Her Childhood Sexual Abuse, 1986During a show on sexual abuse, Winfrey shocked her viewers by revealing that she was raped by a relative at age 9. “There really is no darker secret than sexual abuse. I'm telling you about myself so that maybe the closet where so many sexual abuse victims and their molesters hide might swing open just a crack today and let some light in,” she said during that monumental show. She became an advocate for sexual abuse victims and even testified before the Senate in 1991 on behalf of the National Child Protection Act; the legislation was later nicknamed “The Oprah Bill.”In 2010, Oprah was overwhelmed by the massive response of emails, letters, and phone calls she received after she featured child molesters on her show. “So many victims and parents — and even molesters — came forward,” she has said. “That is exactly the reason why I wanted to do these shows. To get people to step out of the shame, to come forward, to tell somebody.” This is just one — and highly personal — example of how Oprah could turn taboo topics into everyday conversation, raising awareness and possibly saving lives.Here Comes Oprah's Red Wagon of Fat, 1988After she shed 67 pounds, Winfrey showed off her dramatic new shape by wheeling in a red wagon stacked high with the equivalent amount of fat that she lost. She followed a strict liquid diet for four months to slim down to a size 10 Calvin Klein jeans. However, years later, Winfrey admitted she regretted the stunt. “It’s an iconic moment because it was an iconic mistake,” the talk show host said on Good Morning America in 2005. Almost immediately after the show finished taping, Winfrey began to put the pounds back on, marking the beginning of her very public battle with her weight.Winfrey’s weight would yo-yo over the years as she tried different diets with varying success. She hit her heaviest in 1992 at 237 pounds; in 2005 she shrunk to a near-low of 160 pounds, though her weight would creep back up to 200 pounds over the next four years, when she would learn she had hypothyroidism, a condition that can slow metabolism. Now, Winfrey has reevaluated her approach to eating and exercise, opting for small, healthy meals and incorporating strength training into her cardio workouts. “My goal is to be the weight that my body can hold and be healthy and strong and fit and be itself,"" she said.“Her incredibly honest approach to everything she does is what makes her so relatable,"" observes Dr. Oz. Her weight loss struggle is ""a journey that she has shared with her audience, and they learned together how to take care of their bodies and minds.”Therapy With ‘Doctor’ Oprah, 1988Marital therapist Harville Hendrix first appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show in the late 80s to discuss his then ground-breaking Imago Relationship Therapy technique. Your imago, he explained, is the combination of all of the positive and negative traits of your primary childhood caretakers. The partner you choose is based on your imago and has the potential to help resolve issues from your youth. “That show changed me,” Winfrey has said. “I saw relationships not solely as the kind of romantic pursuit our society celebrates but as a spiritual partnership that's meant to change how you see yourself and the world.” Hendrix, whose therapy approach is practiced around the world, has since appeared on the show counseling couples on how to have a healthier, more communicative relationship.Over the 25 seasons of her show, Winfrey, who has been called “America’s therapist,” has dedicated numerous episodes devoted to different kinds of therapy, including sex therapy with Laura Berman, PhD, and self-help and relationship advice from Robin Smith, PhD, and Phil McGraw, PhD (more on him later).Oprah Finishes Her First — and Last — Marathon, 1994After teaming up with trainer Bob Greene two years earlier, Winfrey boldly went where she never dared before: a marathon. To tackle the 26.2-mile course for Washington D.C.’s Marine Corps Marathon, she trained for 20 weeks under the guidance of Greene, who later developed the Best Life diet and continues to counsel Winfrey. Upon finishing, Winfrey said, although making it through was “better than winning an Emmy,” she had no desire to ever run another marathon. Her personal accomplishment sparked a national trend of running marathons, as many Americans set out to beat Oprah’s time of 4 hours, 29 minutes, and 20 seconds.Texas Cattlemen Have a Beef with Oprah, 1998On a 1996 show about the outbreak of mad cow disease in Great Britain, guest and ex-rancher Howard Lyman criticized the practice of feeding cattle processed livestock, which had been linked to mad cow. Winfrey responded, “It has just stopped me cold from eating another burger.” Lyman went on to say that a human outbreak of mad cow disease could make AIDS look like the common cold. The incident created a firestorm of controversy among cattle farmers, who sued Winfrey for libel and claimed that a plummet in beef sales after the show cost them $12 million.In order to continue filming during the court proceedings, Winfrey uprooted her Chicago-based show for more than a month to tape in Texas. There, she met Phil McGraw, PhD, after she hired his firm Courtroom Sciences Inc. to help prepare her for the trial, which she eventually won.Meet Dr. Phil, 1998Following the cattle farmer trial, Winfrey invited Phil McGraw to be a regular on her show for “Tuesdays with Dr. Phil” segments. His tell-it-like-it-is approach to relationships helped viewers effectively communicate, forgive, strengthen their relationships, and more. During one emotionally-charged show, McGraw counseled Jo Ann Compton, who was unable to come to terms with the tragic murder of her daughter. During the show, McGraw asked if her daughter would want her to stay in such pain. After thoughtfully answering no, McGraw answered, “So it wouldn’t be a betrayal. Maybe the betrayal is focusing on the day of her death, rather than celebrating the event of her life.” A seemingly-astonished Compton simply responded, “I never thought of it that way.”His compassionate and at-times tough love approach was not a surprise to Winfrey, though. “He has the foresight and skill to look at any situation, cut through the psychobabble, and call it as he sees it — and he's usually right,"" Winfrey has said. In 2002, McGraw launched his own show, Dr. Phil, produced by Winfrey’s company, Harpo Productions.Oprah Welcomes Mattie Stepanek, 2001Mattie Stepanek first appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show when he was 11 years old. The inspiring boy who wrote poetry he called “heartsongs” had a rare form of muscular dystrophy, a disease that had claimed the lives of his three siblings. ""From the moment I met Mattie Stepanek, I knew it was my privilege that this courageous little boy had drifted into my life,"" Winfrey has said. Stepanek passed away almost three years later, but his legacy as an ambassador for peace- and disability-related causes continues on through his non-profit Mattie J.T. Stepanek Founation. ""It was his dying wish to make a difference that would last longer than his body,"" his mother, Jeni Stepanek, told People magazine. ""And Oprah gave him the gift of opportunity.""Winfrey recently revealed that she wanted to end her show after 20 seasons but it was Stepanek who encouraged her to continue for five more years. ""In May 2003, as I was in the throes of deciding to bring the show to an end, he was a singular force in changing my mind,” Winfrey wrote in the June 2011 issue of O, The Oprah Magazine. “[My] gut told me to pay attention to this angel boy who I believe was a messenger for our time.""Oprah Introduces Dr. Oz, 2004Dr. Oz appeared on Winfrey’s show 55 times in the five years until he launched his own show in 2009 with the help of Harpo Productions. Oprah’s support of Oz regularly brought health issues big and small into our living rooms, as the doctor weighed in on everything from helping viewers quit smoking and the wonders of a neti pot to the shape of our poop. He fielded viewers’ questions, described embarrassing or complicated health issues in plain terms, and encouraged everyone to take their bodies and their health more seriously.Oz’s personal favorite show was about gas, in which he explained that most people do it about 14 times a day, and many people in the studio — including Winfrey — had likely passed gas during the taping. “As soon as I said it, I wondered if I had possibly gone too far,” he says. “I turned to Ms. Winfrey and she had a huge smile and winked at me. That moment cemented our relationship and confirmed for me what I already knew: that she is one of the most genuine people I have ever known.”Oprah Sparks a Bra Revolution, 2005After declaring that as many as eight in 10 women are wearing the wrong size undergarment (which can make you look older and frumpy, not to mention cause shoulder, neck, or back pain), Winfrey started a “bra intervention,” treating the entire studio audience to a custom bra fitting. ""Women of America,"" Oprah declared, ""you need to rise up and get a proper bra fitting.” To help hoist, measure, and mold each woman’s breasts, Winfrey enlisted bra expert Susan Nethero, owner of Intimacy lingerie boutiques. The biggest takeaway: Most women incorrectly opt for a bigger band size instead of a deeper cup size.Oprah Has a Spiritual Awakening with Eckhart Tolle, 2008Winfrey chose self-help author Eckhart Tolle’s A New Earth as part of her wildly popular book club. She called the German-born spiritualist’s work “one of the most important books of our times,” and launched a 10-week webinar hosted by herself and Tolle. During the series, viewers asked questions via Skype about the book’s message of finding inner peace and personal happiness by moving away from an ego-based state of mind, living “in the now,” and finding your mission in life.Tolle’s spiritual influence on Winfrey is just one example of how she’s touted the importance of the mind-body connection. She also introduced viewers to spirituality through the New Age self-help book The Secret, Elizabeth Gilbert’s journey of self-discovery in Eat, Pray, Love, and teachers such as Elizabeth Lesser and Reverend Ed Bacon.Oprah and Gayle Demonstrate the Power of Female Friendship, 2010Oprah’s best friend Gayle King, who hosts the The Gayle King Show on XM radio and Winfrey’s OWN television network and is editor-at-large of O, The Oprah Magazine, has appeared on her show 139 times — more than any other guest. Their decades-long friendship, which started in the 1980s when the two worked together at a Baltimore television station, embodies the essential role that adult female best friends play in the lives of all women. In 2010, King and Winfrey set out on a much-talked about trip to Yosemite National Park; the two-part series was the last of the pair’s on-air “big adventures” — travel-themed segments that also took them on a 10-day-long road trip, a spa getaway in Arizona, and a state fair in Texas.“[Gayle] is ... the mother I never had. She is ... the sister everybody would want. She is the friend that everybody deserves. I don't know a better person. I don't know a better person,"" Winfrey told Barbara Walters of her BFF in 2010.Return to  Women's Health AwarenessBy subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.A new study found that taking hormonal contraceptives may have a small protective effect on severe cases of asthma in reproductive-age women.Lack of maternity care providers and no guaranteed maternity leave were cited as potential causes.How women value sex as they age, and why low-libido treatments are not available, were among the themes explored at the annual menopause meeting.The Supreme Court ruled that employers can refuse to offer birth control coverage as mandated by the Affordable Care Act if they have religious or moral...Count the Kicks, a prevention program, may spare some families from late pregnancy loss.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy."
"Christina Hendricks' Six Secrets to Staying Healthy, Fit, and Sexily Confident",https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/0705/christina-hendricks-secrets-to-staying-healthy-fit-and-sexily-confident.aspx,"As voluptuous Joan Holloway on 'Mad Men,' Hendricks embodies calm professionalism. But how does she stay self-assured in the face of constant Hollywood scrutiny? Turns out it's a mix of Indian food, salsa lessons, and a simple childhood lesson she learned from her mother.As a child growing up in Twin Falls, Idaho, Christina Hendricks knew of at least one four-letter “F” word that was off-limits. (No, not that one.)Raised in an extremely supportive home, Hendricks knew not to utter the word ""fail."" The actress, who most notably plays sassy, sexy secretary Joan Harris (née Holloway) on AMC’s hit drama Mad Men, says that her parents instilled in her and her brother a fearless attitude and an open mind.“My mom never thought there was anything we couldn’t do. If we wanted to do it, she’d say, ‘Well, let’s figure out how to do that,’ whether it was dance or theater,” Hendricks says. If an experience didn’t turn out as successfully as her kids hoped, Mama Hendricks would spin it as a lesson to learn from — instead of a failure to dwell on.Hendricks, who has teamed up with the maker of the eyelash-lengthening drug Latisse to help raise donations for the Make-a-Wish Foundation through LatisseWishesChallenge.com, believes that her mom’s can-do spirit helped build her own red-carpet confidence today. And she wishes more women would adopt such an outlook in their own lives — and maybe even take a cue from the one and only Ms. Holloway.“Joan is an inspirational character,” Hendricks says. “People are really supportive of her, I think, because she’s sort of a survivor. She gets knocked down and she gets right back up again.”But lest you think Hendricks has it all figured out, she’s the first to admit her health and happiness are always works in progress. “I’m constantly trying to learn how to be healthier and take tips from people,” she says. “You have to remind yourself all the time.” Here’s some of the best advice she’s taken to heart:Credit: Apega/WENN.comBy subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.A new study found that taking hormonal contraceptives may have a small protective effect on severe cases of asthma in reproductive-age women.Lack of maternity care providers and no guaranteed maternity leave were cited as potential causes.How women value sex as they age, and why low-libido treatments are not available, were among the themes explored at the annual menopause meeting.The Supreme Court ruled that employers can refuse to offer birth control coverage as mandated by the Affordable Care Act if they have religious or moral...Count the Kicks, a prevention program, may spare some families from late pregnancy loss.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy."
Is Your Marriage Driving You Crazy?,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/is-your-marriage-driving-you-crazy.aspx,"No relationship is perfect — even the happiest couples have problems. The secret is knowing how to deal with your issues before they ruin your marriage and your sanity.Sometimes it’s the little things your husband does (or doesn’t do) that can really drive you crazy. Perhaps he’s constantly late. Or maybe he refuses to help around the house. Whatever the problem, addressing it sooner rather than later is crucial to both the health of your relationship and your sanity. So how do you get your man to stop his irritating behavior? Success will depend on how you communicate your grievances, says Joan Sherman, LMFT, a licensed marriage and family therapist practicing in Lancaster, Pa.Communication issues can contribute to misunderstandings or make frustrating behavior from your mate even worse. Changing your approach could make all the difference. Positive, constructive communication is essential to making sure marriage troubles don’t turn into a troubled marriage, Sherman says.Instead of approaching an issue with a tone of conflict, use a tone of cooperation, she advises. Say something like, “I really need your help with this problem I’m having.” Your spouse will probably be less defensive and more apt to listen if you’re asking for help rather than making accusations.Here are some common marriage issues, plus tips for how to deal with them:He doesn’t help around the house. You’ve been working all day and have finally finished shuttling the kids to their activities, and you’re beat. When you walk in the door, the house is a disaster. But there he is, sitting on the couch and watching ESPN — again. Sherman says this is a big problem for wives. Her advice: Try to understand why he’s not helping. Perhaps he was never taught how to clean or wasn’t encouraged to do so. In many cultures, she adds, housework by men is frowned upon. Once you’ve figured out the reason for his behavior, approach the problem as a team to come up with a solution or compromise.He picks fights over small things. “This means he must be upset about something,” Sherman says. Perhaps he’s stressed out because of work or feels he’s not getting enough sex. Having a calm discussion may help you both figure out what’s upsetting him and what he needs to feel better.He spends too much or too little. “First, don’t talk about money when you’re angry,"" Sherman advises. “When defenses are up, it’s hard to talk. Instead of listening, you’re constantly thinking, ‘What am I going to say next?’” When tempers simmer down, talk about your financial goals with your partner and make a plan you can both stick with — for example, setting up one account for savings and two separate accounts for spending.He’s constantly late. Putting up with a partner who’s always making you wait is frustrating. But Sherman says the first step in solving this marriage problem is finding out why he’s always late. “Perhaps he’s not planning his time well, or he’s scattered and can’t arrange his life in an appropriate way,” she observes. Once you figure out the “why,” the “how can we fix this” will be a lot easier.He doesn’t understand me. Sherman notes that the pressures of work and family can make it easy to feel like you’ve lost a connection to your mate. She suggests you take 10 minutes every day to tell each other what’s going on in your individual lives. But keep your expectations realistic. “Maybe he doesn’t have to understand everything about you,” she says. Remember that you might not understand your husband’s obsession with football or golf, either.It's important to not look at these marriage problems as a “comment on the relationship,"" Sherman says. Just because he doesn’t help around the house doesn’t necessarily mean he doesn’t love you anymore. However, if you’ve tried several times (in a positive manner) to talk about these issues, and your husband blows you off without making any changes in his behavior, that’s a red flag, she says. It might be time to consider professional relationship help.And if you can’t decide whether to call a divorce lawyer or a therapist, you’ve probably waited too long. “If you still love each other, do whatever you can to save the marriage,” Sherman says.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.A new study found that taking hormonal contraceptives may have a small protective effect on severe cases of asthma in reproductive-age women.Lack of maternity care providers and no guaranteed maternity leave were cited as potential causes.How women value sex as they age, and why low-libido treatments are not available, were among the themes explored at the annual menopause meeting.The Supreme Court ruled that employers can refuse to offer birth control coverage as mandated by the Affordable Care Act if they have religious or moral...Count the Kicks, a prevention program, may spare some families from late pregnancy loss.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy."
How to Sweat Less When You're Sweating Bullets,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/how-to-sweat-less-when-youre-sweating-bullets.aspx,"Are you drenched in sweat when others around you seem as cool as cucumbers? You're not alone. Millions of people deal with excessive sweating — but you have more control over this condition than you think.Everyone sweats — but some people sweat much more than others. Hyperhidrosis, or excessive sweating, occurs when a person’s internal cooling system kicks into overdrive. It can be an embarrassing and life-altering condition to live with. But you don’t have to suffer in sticky, sweaty silence. There are several treatments available to help you sweat less — and live more.Sweating is the body’s way of cooling itself. But excessive sweating — or producing as much as five times more sweat than is needed — is a real medical condition. According to the International Hyperhidrosis Society (IHS), as many as 365 million people worldwide experience excessive sweating. It’s an equal opportunity problem, affecting both men and women. People with hyperhidrosis sweat profusely nearly all day, every day.And hyperhidrosis doesn’t just cause physical problems: “It affects personal relationships, work productivity, intimate relationships, exercise and leisure activities, and really all aspects of life,” says Dee Anna Glaser, MD, president of the IHS and professor and interim chairman of the dermatology department at Saint Louis University School of Medicine.In fact, according to a study published in June 2017 in Health and Quality of Life Outcomes, the day-to-day social impact of hyperhidrosis is one of the highest concerns amongst people who have the condition.Sophia Wastler, 43, a small-business owner from Virginia Beach, Virginia, knows that firsthand. She started noticing excessive sweating on her palms and under her arms when she was just 9 or 10 years old. “My teachers would mark my work as messy since the sweat from my palms would get on the paper and smudge the ink,” she recalls, adding that she withdrew socially because she didn’t want other kids to see her sweat. “I would try to hide myself with baggy clothes.”The most common type of excessive sweating is called primary focal hyperhidrosis, meaning the sweating occurs only in specific small areas of the body and is not caused by another medical condition or a medication. The most common areas involved are the armpits, face, palms of the hands, and feet. As in Wastler’s case, it often begins in childhood or adolescence and does not usually occur when the person is asleep.The cause of this type of excessive sweating has not been conclusively pinpointed, but Dr. Glaser says it’s definitely not a hygiene problem. Genetics is thought to play a role; Wastler says there are other cases of excessive sweating in her family tree.Another type of excessive sweating, known as secondary generalized hyperhidrosis, is caused by an underlying medical condition or is a side effect of a medication. The sweating is usually experienced over larger parts of the body and may occur during sleep. Common causes include:Generally, treating these underlying conditions also helps control excessive sweating due to secondary generalized hyperhidrosis.According to a variety of recent studies, the vast majority of people with hyperhidrosis go years before seeking treatment — if they do at all. But Glaser urges everyone who experiences excessive sweating to talk with their doctors, because there are effective treatment options that can be tailored to each person.Traditional excessive sweating treatments include:However, even newer treatments are now available. Many people have found relief with just one or two treatments from a handheld device that emits electromagnetic energy, which destroys sweat glands. And most recently, the FDA has approved a type of topical anticholinergic medication in wipe form that can be used at home.Wastler finally got treated for her excessive sweating when she was 31 years old. A combination of injections and iontophoresis has not only gotten her hyperhidrosis under control, she says, but the treatments literally changed her life. “I felt so invincible that I left my secure job [as a public school teacher] and started my own company,” she says. It’s called the “Starz Program!” and teaches dance, cheerleading, and sports to children in preschools, daycare centers, and private schools worldwide.Although Wastler is doing great now, she believes she waited too long to get treated and wants to warn others against making the same mistake. “I strongly suggest that anyone who thinks they have hyperhidrosis get treated right away,” she says. “After I got treated, it was like a veil was lifted and I could start living and have more confidence in my life.”By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.Repeat after us: Hyperhidrosis isn’t your fault, and you can find relief.A combination of lifestyle modifications along with medication may be most effective for keeping excessive sweat at bay.Do you wake up at night sweating — even when it’s not hot? These tips can help.If you sweat more than most people and are looking for relief, it’s important to communicate the right information to your doctor.Not all work environments are friendly to people who experience excessive sweating — here are some strategies to help you stay dry.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy."

Young Women Who Drink and Drive at Higher Risk of Fatal Accident,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/0403/young-women-who-drink-and-drvie-at-higher-risk-of-fatal-accident.aspx,"Alcohol affects women differently than men. Find out about the risks that women face when they drink and how to know if you might have a problem with alcohol.The effects of alcohol are stronger in women than in men, and women who drink too much alcohol are more likely to suffer from significant alcohol problems than men, studies show. In addition, women who have alcohol problems have higher death rates due to suicide, accidents, and other health related issues — more than twice the rate of men. Given these facts, you may be wondering: Why do women drink, and what can you do to enjoy alcohol without risks to your health?Understanding Why Women DrinkWomen drink for many of the same reasons that men drink: to relax, to gain confidence in social situations, to get to sleep, and to relieve stress.Other reasons why women may drink alcohol include the following:Alcohol Affects Women Differently Than MenThe blood alcohol level in a woman who just drank the same amount of alcohol as a man will be higher because women are usually smaller, have less water in their bodies, and metabolize alcohol more slowly than men.This means that the brain and liver of a woman who drinks are exposed to more alcohol pound for pound than a man's brain and liver. Women who have alcohol problems may drink less than men but still experience the same level of impairment. They can also develop liver damage and other alcohol-related health problems more quickly than men, even though they may be drinking less.Benefits of Alcohol in WomenIf you are a woman over the age of 55, one drink per day may lower your risk for heart disease. Moderate drinking for a woman is defined as one alcoholic drink per day. This translates to one 5-ounce glass of wine, a 12-ounce bottle of beer, or 1.5 ounces of hard liquor.On the other hand, women who drink beyond moderation may increase their risk of heart disease. If you are younger than 55, there may be no health benefits to alcohol consumption.Risks of Alcohol in WomenToo much alcohol consumption clearly has risks for both men and women. Other risks to women who drink alcohol include:Warning Signs of Alcohol ProblemsIf the effects of alcohol are causing problems for you or for others, you may have an alcohol problem. The risk of developing an alcohol problem is greater if you have a family history of alcoholism. Some warning signs of alcohol problems are:If you think you might have an alcohol problem, it's important to get help. Experts believe that the hardest part of getting better is admitting you have a problem.

Task Force: Screen All Potential Moms for Abuse,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/0614/task-force-screen-all-potential-moms-for-abuse.aspx,"As much as we love being women, there are some issues that aren't so fun to deal with – vaginal itching, yeast and urinary tract infection, or worse, cervical cancer.Find out which gynecological problem you might encounter, how to recognize and treat the symptoms and what steps you can take to prevent them. Plus: Are you at risk for breast cancer?1. Yeast Infections A yeast infection is a type of vaginitis, and 3 out of 4 women will experience at least one in their life; half of women will have more than one. Yeast infections can be passed to men, but this is rare.What it is: Yeast infections are caused by a naturally occurring fungal organism called Candida albicans. The acidic environment of the vagina helps keep the yeast from growing, but when the pH  is altered, a yeast infection can occur. Moisture and other irritation can also promote the yeast to grow, causing vaginal itching.Certain medications, antibiotics, steroids and birth control pills, stress, pregnancy, diabetes, and AIDS can kill “good bacteria,” cause changes in hormones or weaken the immune system, which all contribute to yeast infections. (See related article: 14 Embarrassing Sex Questions – Answered) Signs include:Treatment: If you’ve never had a yeast infection, your doctor can diagnose it with a pelvic exam or by taking a swab.RELATED: Bacterial vaginosis or yeast infection: How to tell the differenceFirst-time yeast infections can generally be treated with over-the-counter medications, and symptoms usually clear up within a week. It comes in cream or suppository form, and the cream can also be used to relieve outer vaginal itching.For recurrent yeast infections or hard-to-clear-up infections, your doctor will prescribe an oral antibiotic.What you can do to help prevent vaginal itching and yeast infections:2. Urinary Tract InfectionWhat it is: A UTI is a bacterial infection of your urinary system, which includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. Bacteria from your skin near the rectum or in the vagina can spread and enter through the urethra, causing a UTI. The most common UTI is in the bladder, which can be very painful.More than half of all women will develop a urinary tract infection (UTI) sometime in their lifetimes. Men can develop UTIs too, but they're more common in women because their urethra is shorter, so bacteria have a shorter distance to travel.Sexual intercourse, use of diaphragms, menopause, or a weakened immune system are common causes of UTIs. Signs include:Nausea, lower back pain and fever are some signs of a kidney infection.What you can do to help prevent it:3. Cervical CancerWhat it is: As the third most common type of reproductive organ cancer, about 12,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year. It usually develops slowly over time when normal cells in a woman's cervix become cancerous.Human papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually transmitted infection, is the most common cause of cervical cancer, but not all women who contract HPV will develop cervical cancer.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved vaccines against HPV for females between the ages of 9 and 26.HIV also can weaken the immune system’s ability to fight any infection. Cervical cancer in its earliest stages usually produces no signs, but as the cancer progresses, you might notice:For cancer that’s reached the invasive stage, the following treatments may be performed: hysterectomy, radical trachelectomy, radiation, and chemotherapy. When the cancer is still confined to the cervix, a five-year survival rate is more than 90%.What you can do to help prevent it:Women's Health: How Much Do You Know?As a woman, your health concerns are as unique as your body.

Will Telling Your Doctor You're Being Abused Stop Your Abuser?,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/will-telling-your-doctor-youre-being-abused-stop-your-abuser.aspx,"A federally appointed task force has proposed physician guidelines for domestic violence screening, but some survivors of abuse are questioning whether they're a good idea.Jackie Brown was 18 and pregnant when she married in 2001. It wasn't long before her husband began isolating her, pushing her away from family and friends — ""the typical cycle of domestic violence,"" says the office manager and social media marketer from Richmond, Va. (pictured at left with her children).Name-calling and belittling were soon followed by physical and sexual abuse. Although people noticed her bruises, she says, people reacted differently. ""Some would speak out and tell me to leave him, and others would feel like, 'It's not my business, I'm not getting involved.' ""She didn't let her healthcare providers know about the abuse.""When you feel like somebody may report it, and you're not comfortable with that,"" Brown explains, ""you hide bruises, or you wait until the bruises fade.""Brown's behavior is not uncommon for women who live with an abusive partner. Ashamed of their lack of strength, fearful of having no financial support, isolated geographically or socially by an explosive partner friends don't want to be around — women are often immobilized in volatile relationships. Misguided hope that he will change, loyalty to the institution of marriage, and feeling guilty about bad choices also act like emotional anchors.This weight contributes to why only one-fourth of the 5 million physical assaults — most recently labeled ""intimate partner violence"" — perpetrated against women by their partners are reported to the police each year, according to findings from the government's National Violence Against Women Survey and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).To help those women who politely mask violence at home, a federally appointed but independent panel made up of primary-care providers (including internists, family physicians, nurses, and ob-gyns), has issued draft recommendations that all women of childbearing age — 14 to 46 — should be asked about partner violence, even if they do not show signs or symptoms of abuse.While the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force's (USPSTF) abuse screening seems like a good thing, some treatment providers, experts, and women who have experienced violence do not agree it will help.The USPSTF recommendations were based on a survey of previously published studies on the effectiveness of partner-violence screening. They concluded that various screening questionnaires and tools could accurately identify at-risk women, even those who did not have obvious signs of abuse. The survey, published online in Annals of Internal Medicine, focuses on papers published since 2004, when the task force initially decided that there was not enough evidence to recommend routine domestic violence screening by doctors.""Anybody who comes in with suspicious injuries or symptoms, lots of signs and symptoms suggesting abuse, that’s not screening,"" says Heidi Nelson, MD, MPH, an epidemiologist at the Oregon Evidence-Based Practice Center in Portland and lead author on the Annals study. ""A physician would, of course, go there, ask questions. What this focuses on is a woman coming in for her usual physical exam, her prenatal exam, to get her hypertension prescription renewed — those routine visits.""Of the different screening tests used, the task force identified six that worked best for identifying intimate partner violence, with acronyms such as HITS (Hurt, Insult, Threaten, Scream) and HARK (Humiliation, Afraid, Rape, Kick). But it’s largely up to the individual doctor which one he or she uses. “The studies suggest that there are a variety of ways in which doctors can screen,” says Kirsten Bibbens-Domingo, MD, a member of the task force. “The most important thing to do is to actually ask.”The guidelines focus on reproductive-age women on the premise that violence tends to escalate when women are pregnant.""Most of the studies that have been done were done around the time of pregnancy because that is a particularly high-risk time,"" says Dr. Bibbens-Domingo. ""We know that violence is devastating to individuals and families no matter at what age it occurs — this recommendation speaks specifically to intimate partner violence, and the evidence is clear for women at reproductive ages.”Brown, who had another child before ending her marriage in 2007, verifies that abuse ""definitely did escalate when I was pregnant with my son, and it was obviously more of a danger because it wasn't only my life.""For those who think teenagers might be too young to be included in partner violence screening programs, a 2009 CDC survey found that about 10 percent of adolescents reported being the victim of partner violence the preceding year. And data show that teen girls with physically abusive partners are three to four times more likely to become pregnant than those not in such relationships, notes Rebecca Levenson, senior policy analyst at Futures Without Violence, a San Francisco, Calif.-based nonprofit organization and a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services-funded national resource center on health and domestic violence.The domestic violence community welcomes the recommendations, says Levenson: ""When women have been surveyed — and they’ve been surveyed many, many times about ‘Do you think healthcare is a place where women should be asked about domestic violence?' — 97 percent of the time they say, 'Yes, this is the right thing to do.' ”But Alexis Moore, a violence survivor and founder of the national advocacy group Survivors in Action, disagrees: ""It may look good on paper, but there are dangerous ramifications."" Victims are 75 times more likely to be severely injured or killed after they leave or try to leave a relationship, according to the Crisis Intervention Center in Fort Smith, Ark.Moore, a risk management consultant in El Dorado Hills, Calif., believes a lack of training among physicians about how to deal with domestic violence could have catastrophic consequences if they learn that someone is abused and give them the wrong advice or information.""They are not trained, they do not know the services and resources available. All they do is hand out a brochure,"" she says.In 2004, says Moore, she was referred to a shelter but was turned away because her batterer was an investigator: ""I didn't have a Plan B. I was told to return back home and was subsequently almost beaten to death.""Survivors in Action has launched a campaign, STOP-VERIFY-REFER, that calls for anyone making a domestic violence referral to verify first that the agency or service to which they're referring the abuse victim is active and able to help. Moore says the campaign is an attempt to stop what she calls ""auto-pilot referrals.""""Once they hand off the patient,"" Moore explains, ""they can check the box and meet compliance with state or federal law. But the provider does not know whether the agency they're referring the victim to will indeed help that victim. Would [a physician] give a drug that they didn't know anything about?""""People who don't understand the intricacies of intimate partner violence may give advice that can be dangerous,"" says Lynn Fairweather, MSW, a Portland, Oregon-based trainer and consultant specializing in interpersonal violence response and prevention. Fairweather, the author of Stop Signs: Recognizing, Avoiding, and Escaping Abusive Relationships, says telling the victim to ""just walk away"" or ""just leave him"" is unrealistic and unhelpful. ""If women leave without a plan, they are much more likely to return to that situation and be assaulted.""""Screening is only effective if it's followed with something else,"" says Bibbens-Domingo. ""The evidence suggests that a range of follow-ups are effective — referral to community services, home visits, mentoring to figure out the appropriate next steps.""The USPSTF's draft follows similar recommendations by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) published this past February in Obstetrics & Gynecology. According to an article in The Lancet, the ACOG screening guidelines have raised concern about mandatory reporting laws, which vary from state to state.“Even if you have great guidelines, there can be unintended consequences,” Maria Luisa O'Neill of the Denver National Coalition Against Domestic Violence told The Lancet.""There's a whole lot of reasons why women stay [with an abuser],"" says Fairweather. A lack of financial resources is the most common, but fear also plays a big role. ""Many times abusers say, 'If you leave me, I will kill you.' And [women] have good reason to believe that.""Levenson, whose group worked with ACOG on their guidelines, says that while a few states — Colorado, Kentucky, California, New Mexico, and Rhode Island — require healthcare providers to report domestic violence, “many others” do not: “Depending upon the state, the law is very different. In California, if there’s an injury, you’re required to report it.” But, she says, if the person makes a statement such as “This is happening to me,” the doctor is not required to report it.""A good screening program will inform people how the information is going to be used,"" says Dr. Nelson, adding that the clinician and patient should decide together what is the appropriate next step.For her part, Jackie Brown believes that mandatory reporting would make women less likely to answer screening questions truthfully.""Where am I going to go? What am I going to do? What is he going to do when he gets out of jail? All of these things go through a woman's head,"" she says. ""Oftentimes when you proceed with either reporting or screening, sometimes the woman feels more victimized because she feels like she has lost all control of the situation and has no choice in the outcome.""""We’re concerned about potential harms,” which may include the abuser retaliating, as well as the stigma of victimization, or incorrectly identifying someone as a victim, says Bibbens-Domingo. But, ""when you have this type of strong evidence base, we came to the conclusion that the benefits outweighed the harm.”But survivors like Brown and Moore are unconvinced.""Doctors are not very proactive,"" says Moore. ""If they could wash their hands and not involve themselves, they probably would. There needs to be more thought and more time spent discussing this issue with victims and survivors. This is a very complicated situation, and it can't be resolved by people sitting around a conference table.""Brown, who says she and her kids are doing ""fantastic"" now, agrees. ""Statistics don’t tell you about the emotional side of things. They don’t describe that to you.""Fairweather, who's also a survivor, says she was asked about violence by people in her life, including doctors, while the abuse was going on. But she never said a word: ""I'm a middle-class white female. It was as though they were saying, ‘We don’t think this could be happening to a woman like you, but is anyone hurting you at home?' So I kept my mouth shut."" But, she notes, the proposed recommendations ""are better than nothing. It certainly is going to give information to a lot of physicians about domestic violence and put it on their radar. That's a good thing.""The USPSTF has a history of making controversial recommendations. Recently, the task force came out against annual prostate cancer screening in men over age 50, and back in 2009, they released guidelines saying routine screening mammograms for breast cancer were unnecessary in women younger than 50. In June 2012, the American Medical Association's House of Delegates came out in support of yearly mammograms beginning at age 40, in what was seen as a direct rebuttal of the task force's recommendation.It's also important to note that the proposed domestic violence screening recommendations are just that — recommendations, not requirements. If you have an opinion about them, there’s still time to weigh in before the final guidelines are posted. Since December 2011, all USPSTF draft statements are open for public comment at their Web site. “We read all of the comments and use them as we draft the final recommendation statement,” says Bibbens-Domingo.

Computer Screen for Domestic Abuse No Help,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/0815/computer-screen-for-domestic-abuse-no-help.aspx,"As much as we love being women, there are some issues that aren't so fun to deal with – vaginal itching, yeast and urinary tract infection, or worse, cervical cancer.Find out which gynecological problem you might encounter, how to recognize and treat the symptoms and what steps you can take to prevent them. Plus: Are you at risk for breast cancer?1. Yeast Infections A yeast infection is a type of vaginitis, and 3 out of 4 women will experience at least one in their life; half of women will have more than one. Yeast infections can be passed to men, but this is rare.What it is: Yeast infections are caused by a naturally occurring fungal organism called Candida albicans. The acidic environment of the vagina helps keep the yeast from growing, but when the pH  is altered, a yeast infection can occur. Moisture and other irritation can also promote the yeast to grow, causing vaginal itching.Certain medications, antibiotics, steroids and birth control pills, stress, pregnancy, diabetes, and AIDS can kill “good bacteria,” cause changes in hormones or weaken the immune system, which all contribute to yeast infections.

Urinary Tract InfectionWhat it is: A UTI is a bacterial infection of your urinary system, which includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. Bacteria from your skin near the rectum or in the vagina can spread and enter through the urethra, causing a UTI. The most common UTI is in the bladder, which can be very painful.More than half of all women will develop a urinary tract infection (UTI) sometime in their lifetimes. Men can develop UTIs too, but they're more common in women because their urethra is shorter, so bacteria have a shorter distance to travel.Sexual intercourse, use of diaphragms, menopause, or a weakened immune system are common causes of UTIs. Signs include:Nausea, lower back pain and fever are some signs of a kidney infection.What you can do to help prevent it:3. Cervical CancerWhat it is: As the third most common type of reproductive organ cancer, about 12,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year.

Happiness Gene in Women Identified,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/happiness-gene-in-women-identified.aspx,"The MAOA gene is the first-ever identified as leading to happiness – but not in men.Wednesday, Aug. 28, 2012 — The happiness gene might have been discovered, but sorry guys — it's only relevant for women.A study published in July 2012 in the journal Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry found that the gene MAOA, also known as the ""warrior gene"" for its association with alcoholism, aggressiveness and antisocial behavior, is linked to higher levels of happiness in adult females.""This is the first-ever identified happiness gene for women,"" said lead author Henian Chen, Ph.D at the University of South Florida. ""This is important because there are many studies on abnormal people with MDD, anxiety disorder and personality disorders. We need more studies on the psychology for normal people, because most of us are normal.""Chen's team studied data on 193 women and 152 men. All the participants had taken part in a mental health study, and their DNA analyzed for MAOA gene variation. Happiness was measured by a widely used and validated happiness scale developed by researchers at the University of California Riverside. Researchers controlled for various factors including age, education and income.The results showed women with the MAOA gene were happier than women without it. While men carry the same gene — it's been called the ""warrior gene"" by some scientists who have studied its possible impact — it didn't seem to lead to greater happiness in men with the active variety than in those without it.One reason researchers think gender makes a difference is because women have lower testosterone levels then men — they speculate high testosterone levels neutralize the happiness effects of MAOA.Chen said he was surprised by the result because the MAOA gene was negatively associated with alcoholism, aggressiveness and antisocial behavior.And if you're wondering, turns out money can't buy happiness. Chen found that folks weren't any happier once their income increased. ""Our results show that income is not an independent predictor of human happiness,"" he said. Unemployment, however, was shown to decrease happiness in test subjects.Chen said it’s important to further study the impact specific genes have on our well-being.Studies of identical twins raised in different environments ""estimate genetic factors account for 35 to 50 percent of the variance in human happiness,"" he said.

"Flirting Pays Off, New Study Finds",https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/1010/flirting-pays-off-new-study-finds.aspx,"Subtle flirting, not over-the-top sexuality, helps women achieve negotiating objectives.WEDNESDAY, Oct. 10, 2012 —  Yes, ladies, you are as charming as you think you are. That's the finding of a new study on flirting from Berkeley's Haas School of Business at the University of California.From the seductive femme fatale to the love-at-first-sight girl next door, women have often demonstrated power over men. And this new study suggests how it's done. ""Feminine Charm: An Experimental Analysis of its Costs and Benefits in Negotiations,"" published in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, found that women who flirt get what they want.Researchers sought to measure the impact of subtle, casual flirting, not over-the-top sexual advances: a slight touch of arm or a confident bat of an eye. They found that flirting helped women achieve negotiating objectives.""Women are uniquely confronted with a tradeoff in terms of being perceived as strong versus warm. Using feminine charm in negotiation is a technique that combines both,"" says Laura Kray, Haas School of Business professor and study author.According to the study, co-authored by Haas PhD alumna Connson C. Locke of the London School of Economics and Haas PhD candidate Alex B. Van Zant, for flirting to yield optimal negotiating results, it must come across as genuine and engaging, yet lacking a serious agenda.Kray also suggests that flirting is not unprofessional. ""The key is to flirt with your own natural personality in mind. Be authentic. Have fun. That will translate into confidence, which is a strong predictor of negotiation performance.""Even former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright admitted to flirting her way through negotiations when asked by comedian Bill Maher back in 2009.To evaluate the social charm of men vs. women, 100 participants were asked to rate their own use of flirtation in negotiations. Additionally, subjects assessed their partners' negotiating success. Results proved that women who self-reported a higher rate of flirtation, were seen as more effective by their partners. However, men who self-reported an inflated rate of flirtation, were not.Researchers also surveyed the men and women on two hypothetical situations regarding the selling of a car. One involved a serious female customer shopping for the best price, while the other described a buyer who smiled, touched, and winked at her seller while playfully inquiring about cost.Again, results showed that men were more than willing to give the flirtatious shopper a discount while women were unaffected by the customer's flirtatious behavior.Have a good flirting story or just want to share your opinion?

Estrogen Debate Continues: The WHI Side,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/estrogen-debate-continues-the-whi-side.aspx,"Estrone, estradiol, and estriol are the three main types of estrogen.Estrogen is a group of hormones produced by a woman's ovaries and, to a lesser degree, by the adrenal glands, fat tissues, and a man's testes. It is considered a sex hormone because it is produced by the reproductive organs and affects these organs, too. (1)Both men and women produce estrogen, but it's usually considered a ""female hormone"" because men have smaller amounts in their bodies.Estrogen flows through the bloodstream and binds to estrogen receptors on cells. The hormone has effects on the brain, bone, liver, heart, skin, and other tissues in the body, and regulates metabolic processes, such as cholesterol levels. (2,3)Estrone, estradiol, and estriol are the three main types of estrogen.Estrogen helps initiate physical changes that happen to girls during puberty, such as the start of their menstrual cycles and developing secondary sex characteristics, including breasts and body hair. (2)Estrogen helps regulate the menstrual cycle during a woman's childbearing years and controls the growth of the uterine lining.Estradiol is most common in women of childbearing age. During pregnancy, estriol is produced by the placenta, and estrone is the only hormone your body produces after menopause (when you no longer get your period). (3)In men, estrogen is important to the growth of healthy bones and the development of the male reproductive system. However, not much more is known about estrogen's role in men. (3)As women reach menopause (when they stop menstruating), the ovaries begin to produce less estrogen. (3)When this happens, your doctor may recommend taking prescription estrogen to help with severe menopausal symptoms, such as:Your doctor may also prescribe estrogen if:When men don't have enough estrogen, they can carry excess belly fat and experience low sexual desire.Estrogen usually comes as a tablet that you'll take by mouth, with or without food.Your dose and how often you take it will depend on your reason for taking it.Talk with your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about how you should take your estrogen.Tell your doctor if you experience any of the following side effects: (1)Call your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following serious side effects:Concerns about hormone therapy began in the early 2000s when the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) study reported a link between combined estrogen and progestin and an increased risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular disease. The study also stated that hormone therapy caused more harm than good in postmenopausal women, showing that estrogen alone appeared to be related to an increased risk of stroke and was not beneficial for coronary artery disease. (4)WHI alarmed the medical community in 2002 with study results in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) reporting that, after following participants for a mean of five years, the researchers had stopped the estrogen-plus-progestin portion of their study prematurely because the excess risk of breast cancer facing the women taking the drugs made it unethical to continue. (5)Then, two years later, the estrogen-only study was also stopped ahead of time, because it also uncovered an increased risk of blood clots. For these women, though, there was no significant increase in breast cancer risk. (6)More current analyses do not show these risks to be associated (or present) with hormone therapy, including a follow-up study published in September 2017 in JAMA. The study found that neither estrogen-plus-progestin taken for a median of 5.6 years, nor estrogen alone taken for a median of 7.2 years, was associated with increased risk of all-cause, cardiovascular, or cancer mortality during a cumulative follow-up of 18 years. (7)Given the concerns and past controversy surrounding hormone therapy, talk with your doctor about whether this treatment is a good option for you.Women can have too much estrogen (often referred to as estrogen dominance). When this happens, the following can occur: (3)When men's estrogen levels are too high, they can have enlarged breasts (gynecomastia), infertility, and difficulty maintaining an erection. (3)Based on what your doctor determines is causing your high estrogen levels, he or she may prescribe a medication, suggest surgery, or recommend dietary changes to help lower your estrogen levels.In addition to oral contraception for birth control, your doctor may prescribe one made with estrogen to help relieve menstrual cramps and some perimenopausal symptoms or to regulate periods if you have polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).

Plus: Are you at risk for breast cancer?1. Yeast Infections A yeast infection is a type of vaginitis, and 3 out of 4 women will experience at least one in their life; half of women will have more than one. Yeast infections can be passed to men, but this is rare.What it is: Yeast infections are caused by a naturally occurring fungal organism called Candida albicans. The acidic environment of the vagina helps keep the yeast from growing, but when the pH  is altered, a yeast infection can occur. Moisture and other irritation can also promote the yeast to grow, causing vaginal itching.Certain medications, antibiotics, steroids and birth control pills, stress, pregnancy, diabetes, and AIDS can kill “good bacteria,” cause changes in hormones or weaken the immune system, which all contribute to yeast infections. (See related article: 14 Embarrassing Sex Questions – Answered) Signs include:Treatment: If you’ve never had a yeast infection, your doctor can diagnose it with a pelvic exam or by taking a swab.RELATED: Bacterial vaginosis or yeast infection: How to tell the differenceFirst-time yeast infections can generally be treated with over-the-counter medications, and symptoms usually clear up within a week. It comes in cream or suppository form, and the cream can also be used to relieve outer vaginal itching.For recurrent yeast infections or hard-to-clear-up infections, your doctor will prescribe an oral antibiotic.What you can do to help prevent vaginal itching and yeast infections:2. Urinary Tract InfectionWhat it is: A UTI is a bacterial infection of your urinary system, which includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. Bacteria from your skin near the rectum or in the vagina can spread and enter through the urethra, causing a UTI. The most common UTI is in the bladder, which can be very painful.More than half of all women will develop a urinary tract infection (UTI) sometime in their lifetimes. Men can develop UTIs too, but they're more common in women because their urethra is shorter, so bacteria have a shorter distance to travel.Sexual intercourse, use of diaphragms, menopause, or a weakened immune system are common causes of UTIs. Signs include:Nausea, lower back pain and fever are some signs of a kidney infection.What you can do to help prevent it:3. Cervical CancerWhat it is: As the third most common type of reproductive organ cancer, about 12,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year. It usually develops slowly over time when normal cells in a woman's cervix become cancerous.Human papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually transmitted infection, is the most common cause of cervical cancer, but not all women who contract HPV will develop cervical cancer.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved vaccines against HPV for females between the ages of 9 and 26.HIV also can weaken the immune system’s ability to fight any infection. Cervical cancer in its earliest stages usually produces no signs, but as the cancer progresses, you might notice:For cancer that’s reached the invasive stage, the following treatments may be performed: hysterectomy, radical trachelectomy, radiation, and chemotherapy. When the cancer is still confined to the cervix, a five-year survival rate is more than 90%.What you can do to help prevent it:Women's Health: How Much Do You Know?As a woman, your health concerns are as unique as your body.

"Mediterranean Diet May Help Women Live Longer, Healthier Lives",https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/1105/mediterranean-diet-may-help-women-live-longer-healthier-lives.aspx,"Healthy diet plan may give heart benefit to middle-aged women but does not significantly affect men’s stroke risk, study says.Aging and being a woman are two risk factors for stroke that you can’t control, but following a certain diet plan may help older women reduce their chances of this serious health event. A study published in September 2018 in Stroke found that women over age 40 who ate a Mediterranean diet lowered their stroke risk by an average of 22 percent. Women have more strokes, and die from more strokes, than men every year, and the risk of stroke for both sexes doubles every 10 years after age 55, according to the American Stroke Association.“Our research shows us that following a Mediterranean-style diet that is rich in fish, fruits, nuts, vegetables, and beans and lower in meat and dairy, may reduce stroke risk for women over 40,” says lead study author Ailsa Welch, PhD, a professor of nutritional epidemiology at the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom.Researchers didn’t observe the same protective effect of the diet in men, who had a statistically insignificant risk reduction of 6 percent from following the diet, but, Dr. Welch says, “A healthy, balanced diet is important for everyone, both young and old.”Prior research suggests the Mediterranean diet may be especially helpful for preventing heart disease and stroke. For instance, an October 2017 meta-analysis in Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition found that the approach — and especially a diet high in olive oil, veggies, fruit, and legumes — may help protect against heart disease incidence and heart-disease-related death.RELATED: 5 Ways to Protect Yourself From a StrokeThe current study results are based on the health data of about 10,600 men and 12,700 women in England. Participants were between ages 40 and 77 and kept track of their eating with seven-day diet diaries. During the 17-year study period, 2,009 strokes occurred.Women in the study who closely adhered to a Mediterranean diet saw a protective effect against stroke regardless of their menopausal status or whether they underwent hormone replacement therapy.“It is unclear why we found differences between women and men, but it could be that components of the diet may influence men differently than women,” says lead researcher Phyo Myint, MD, clinical chair of medicine at the University of Aberdeen School of Medicine in Scotland. “The differences we found may be due to differences in risk factors that affect women only or to differences in women’s response for risk factors such as [high] blood pressure and diabetes.”Sarah Samaan, MD, a cardiologist with Baylor Scott & White Health in Plano, Texas, who was not involved in the study, says the results attest to the potentially beneficial effects of the Mediterranean diet.“Since the diet does appear to lower heart attack risk in both men and women and also helps protect against other chronic conditions, including dementia and cancer, it is a good choice for most people,” says Dr. Samaan.A review published in July 2017 in Nutrients suggests people who eat a Mediterranean diet appear to have a higher intake of brain-boosting nutrients such as vitamin B12, vitamin D, iron, zinc, calcium, folic acid, selenium, and iodine, potentially providing protection from Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia. And an October 2017 review in Nutrients suggests the approach may also help lower the risk of several types of cancer, including colorectal cancer and breast cancer.“The fact that it may not be as protective against stroke for men as compared with women is no reason to avoid choosing this type of diet,” Samaan says.Authors of the current study also found that participants who were already at high risk of heart disease had an overall reduced stroke risk of 13 percent.Welch says among the limitations of the research was that diets were only evaluated at the start of the investigation. “So we cannot exclude the possibility that people’s diets changed during the study period,” she says.She also says that the participants lacked racial diversity, so there was not enough data to understand the relationship between diet and stroke for a nonwhite population.“Future research needs to investigate why men and women differ in response to the Mediterranean diet, and if this is due to the differences in risk factors that affect women only, or whether women respond differently [to] risk factors such as blood pressure and diabetes,” says Welch.RELATED: What Are the Causes and Symptoms of Stroke?Factors that may increase older women’s risk of stroke include smoking, pregnancy, a history of preeclampsia/eclampsia or gestational diabetes, oral contraceptive use (especially when combined with smoking), and postmenopausal hormone therapy, according to the American Stroke Association.A stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain is decreased or completely cut off. This may be caused by a clot in a blood vessel (ischemic stroke) or by a burst or leak in a weakened blood vessel (hemorrhagic stroke). Deprived of oxygen, brain cells can die, causing a loss of functions such as memory, speech, and muscle control.RELATED: Think You’re Too Young for a Stroke?

"Study: Women at Higher Risk for Allergies, Asthma",https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/1108/study-women-at-higher-risk-for-allergies-asthma.aspx,"Allergies occur when your immune system overreacts to substances called allergens. Common allergens that can trigger allergic reactions include pollen, pet dander, and bee venom. People also have allergies to certain foods and medications.Allergies are the sixth leading cause of chronic illness in the United States. More than 50 million Americans each year suffer from an allergy-related disease or condition, including hay fever, asthma, conjunctivitis or pink eye, hives, eczema or atopic dermatitis, and sinus infection or sinusitis. (1)According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), at least 20 million Americans 18 and older and more than 6.1 million children were diagnosed with allergic rhinitis, commonly known as hay fever, in 2015. Another 20 million Americans were diagnosed with respiratory, food, or skin allergies. (2)Your risk of developing allergies is higher if you:Children sometimes outgrow allergies as they get older. It's also not uncommon for allergies to go away and then return years later.You may have more than one allergy. Children with food allergies, for instance, are as much as four times more likely to have other allergic conditions, including asthma. (3)More than 100 genes are associated with allergies, although only one or two genes affect any given population. Some of these genes affect the immune response; others affect lung and airway function. (4)Allergens are typically harmless substances that trigger an immune response and cause a reaction in people who are allergic. The allergic reaction occurs if the person inhales, touches, swallows, injects, or somehow comes into contact with the allergen. Allergic reactions can be mild, severe, or even life threatening.Normally, the immune system protects the body against harmful substances, such as viruses or bacteria. If you have allergies, “your body responds to allergens as if they were invaders,” explains Clifford Bassett, MD, a clinical assistant professor at New York University Langone Health in New York City and the author of The New Allergy Solution. “Your body exaggerates the immune response. That’s what causes histamine release and other things that cause allergy misery.”Histamine acts as a neurotransmitter, sending messages between cells. It plays a key role in many different physiological functions, such as telling your stomach to produce acid to digest food or helping regulate your sleep-wake cycle. (5)When your immune system reacts to an allergen, it produces an antibody called immunoglobulin E (IgE). The production of IgE is part of your body's attempt to destroy the allergen and protect itself. Your blood vessels dilate and become leaky, so white blood cells that fight infection and other protective substances leave the blood vessels to attack the invader.In the process, the IgE antibodies signal other cells to release certain chemicals, such as histamine. Too much histamine in the body can cause an unwanted response that leads to skin, nose, throat, and lung irritation.In this way, a normally protective process creates a cascade of what we know as allergy symptoms in response to harmless allergens. (5)The most common allergens that trigger allergic reactions include:Eczema can be triggered by irritants in your home. Here’s how to reduce exposure to dust mites, pet dander, and more.Allergy symptoms vary, depending on the type of allergens.Rhinitis, for instance, is commonly associated with the following symptoms:An allergic food reaction may share some of the above symptoms, but it can also cause:A skin allergy or insect bite can cause the following at the site:The symptoms of a drug allergy may include:Learn More About Allergy SymptomsCertain allergies can strike at any time during the year. Seasonal allergies, on the other hand, occur at times of the year when certain types of outdoor allergens are more predominant.“You can have both,” says Dr. Bassett. About two-thirds of people with seasonal allergies also have year-round or persistent allergies.Seasonal allergies are most often triggered by mold and pollen from trees, grasses, and weeds such as ragweed. The allergic reaction occurs during the weeks or months when the plant pollinates.Allergy triggers may vary depending on geographic location and climate, but relocating to avoid seasonal allergies generally doesn’t help. Pollen and mold spores travel great distances; and people with allergies often develop sensitivity to other allergens in a different location.Environmental factors such as pollution and climate change associated with rising temperatures may be contributing to a rise in allergies. Changes in the duration and intensity of pollen and mold seasons mean more people are exposed to allergens for longer amounts of time. “That’s a longer period of time for your eyes and nose and throat to become symptomatic as a result,” Bassett says.In a 2015 survey of allergists, 63 percent of respondents felt climate change was causing an increase in allergic symptoms among their patients. (7)Not everyone who has allergy-like symptoms has an allergy. For example, at least one-third of people with nasal symptoms do not have allergies. (8)Like allergies, a cold and the flu affect the respiratory system; and they share some symptoms, such as a runny nose and coughing.One difference between them is the itchiness associated with many allergic reactions. “Typically, an allergy will have itchiness of the eyes, nose, and throat,” says Bassett. “With a cold, you’re more likely to have a sore throat, decrease in appetite, and you just don’t feel well.""Allergy symptoms last as long as you are exposed to an allergen, whereas a cold or the flu usually runs its course within two weeks. Flu symptoms tend to be more severe than cold symptoms, accompanied by a fever and possibly headache, fatigue, and aches and pains. (9)“If you have a cold, there’s no real good treatment, other than waiting five to seven days,” Bassett says. But for a non-severe allergy, “if you use an antihistamine or nasal steroid spray, they’re usually very effective.”Other conditions that produce allergy-like symptoms include:Learn About Allergy MythsPeople with allergies are at risk of developing complications that range from mild to potentially life threatening.One of the most serious allergic complications is anaphylaxis, which is commonly associated with allergies involving food, drugs like penicillin, and insect venom.Symptoms of anaphylaxis may include:Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency. It can cause seizures, arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat), shock, or respiratory distress. (11)If you or someone around you has an anaphylactic reaction, call 911 or seek immediate medical attention.Asthma is a chronic lung disease characterized by inflamed airways and trouble breathing. An asthma attack causes chest tightness, coughing, wheezing, and episodes of severe shortness of breath.In 2015, more than 24 million people in the United States had asthma, and nearly half had an asthma attack. (12,13)Allergies and asthma are on a spectrum and frequently overlap, says Bassett. Ninety percent of children and 50 percent of adults with asthma have allergic asthma. (14)Allergic asthma causes inflamed airways to become irritated and over-respond when an irritant is inhaled, triggering an asthma attack. The muscles around the airways tighten, making the airways swell and overproduce mucus. The risk of developing asthma if you have allergic rhinitis is significant, Bassett says.People with allergies are also at risk of developing:The first step in diagnosing allergies is an evaluation by your physician to review your symptoms and medical history and to rule out other potential medical problems.You can help your doctor make an accurate diagnosis by keeping a record of your symptoms, including when they started and what triggers them.If your doctor suspects allergies, he may order one or more tests. These include skin and blood tests. Your doctor may also perform a lung function test or an X-ray of your lungs.Learn More About Allergy DiagnosisThere are no cures for allergies, but effective treatment can reduce symptoms and improve your quality of life.Allergy treatments vary, depending on the severity of your condition and the type of allergy you have.If your allergies are severe enough to significantly interfere with your quality of life, it's a good idea to see a doctor in order to identify what you are allergic to and to gain access to the full range of prescription options.If your allergies are less severe or merely annoying, you may be able to find an effective over-the-counter (OTC) treatment. A pharmacist may be able to help you choose the best option based on your symptoms.Over-the-counter remedies include antihistamines (which block the effects of histamine), and decongestants and nasal steroid sprays (which relieve congestion).Your doctor may prescribe allergy shots (immunotherapy), which lessen your immune system’s reaction to allergens, and steroids, which reduce inflammation and swelling.You may also need medications for asthma. If you have severe allergic reactions and are at risk for anaphylaxis, then your doctor may recommend that you carry a dose of epinephrine, a chemical that narrows blood vessels and opens airways in the lungs.Complementary remedies, such as acupuncture, and nasal irrigation techniques may also help relieve allergy symptoms.Learn More About Allergy TreatmentsAs medication costs rapidly rise, millions of Americans are feeling the burden.

"Disturbing Link Between Domestic Violence, Abortions",https://www.everydayhealth.com/emotional-health/0108/disturbing-link-between-domestic-violence-abortions.aspx,"Psychotherapy, medication, and electroconvulsive therapy can help alleviate various forms of depression, from mild to severe.Depression is a serious mental illness that can cause real pain for the people who have it and for their loved ones.Depression is one of the most common mental disorders in the United States, according to the National Institute of Mental Health, affecting more than 17 million adults (about 7 percent of the adult population) as well as more than 3 million adolescents between ages 12 and 17.For a majority of these men and women and an even higher proportion of these children, depression results in severe impairment. (1)RELATED: Detecting and Diagnosing Depression: It Can Look Different in Men and Women and in Teenagers, TooPsychotherapy, or talk therapy, is designed to help people identify and effectively deal with the psychological, behavioral, interpersonal, and situational aspects of their depression.Different types of psychotherapy have different goals. According to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, these goals include helping people: (2)Two of the most common types of psychotherapy used for depression are cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy.According to the American Psychiatric Association, CBT helps people identify harmful or ineffective patterns of thinking and behavior and replace them with more accurate thoughts and functional behaviors.People undergoing CBT often have “homework"" between sessions in which they practice their new skills in the “real” world.Interpersonal therapy helps patients understand underlying issues and helps them learn healthy ways to express emotions and improve how they communicate with others. (3)RELATED: 9 Different Types of DepressionAntidepressants, first developed in the 1950s, are drugs that moderate neurotransmitters — chemicals in the brain that regulate mood, such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine.About 13 percent of Americans age 12 and older report taking antidepressants, according to the National Center for Health Statistics, with women about twice as likely as men to take antidepressants (roughly 16 percent versus 9 percent).A quarter of all people who take antidepressants have done so for a decade or longer. (4)There are many different types of depression medications available today. Most fall into the following drug classes, grouped by their effect on brain chemistry:Some widely used antidepressants don’t fall into the above categories, such as Wellbutrin (buproprion).All these medications require a prescription from a physician and usually take several weeks to begin working. They also have possible side effects that your doctor can discuss with you. (2)RELATED: 7 Common Myths About DepressionWhen psychotherapy and medications don’t relieve symptoms of depression or there is a high risk of suicide, doctors may turn to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Once called electroshock therapy, ECT has come a very long way since it was first used, in the 1940s.ECT passes an electrical current through the brain while the person is under general anesthesia, causing a brief, controlled seizure that affects neurons and brain chemistry. The person wakes up 5 or 10 minutes afterward, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), and is ready to resume normal activities in about an hour.Most people undergo four to six treatments before they see significant improvement; after that they may have ECT less frequently, followed, in some cases, by “maintenance” ECT, possibly every month or once a year.ECT may cause temporary side effects, including headaches, muscle pain, nausea, confusion, and memory loss.Another option for treatment-resistant depression is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which uses magnetic fields to stimulate neurons, targeting the brain area thought to be involved with regulating moods. (5)RELATED: How to Cope With Caregiver DepressionResearchers continue to make progress in developing new kinds of antidepressant treatments. In 2019 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved two first-of-their-kind medications:People with severe depression require help from medical professionals — they can’t treat themselves — but lifestyle changes can supplement other treatments or counter mild depression.These include:Some people with depression turn to the herb St. John’s wort as a home remedy, but doctors are concerned about interactions with other medications.

Raising Awareness of Women's Heart Health,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/raising-awareness-of-womens-heart-health-issues.aspx,"Heart disease is not exclusive to men, and more than ever before, heart organizations are making sure women get that message.Depending on where you live, you may have noticed more promotions targeting women about heart disease awareness. Posters, television ads, even special heart disease awareness days, have been created to help remind women about this serious condition and what can be done to prevent it.Why the focus on women? There's a common misconception that heart disease only affects men, but statistics show that this is just not true. In the United States, 1 in 2.4 women die of heart disease compared to one in 29 who die of breast cancer. Still, breast cancer remains a more widely feared and publicized health issue in the United States. This year alone, 9,000 U.S. women under the age of 45 will have heart attacks. Without better awareness of prevention measures, these numbers will continue to rise.More Women Die of Heart Attack Than MenAlthough women don’t have heart attacks more often than men, said Jennifer Lawton, MD, associate professor of surgery in the division of cardiothoracic surgery at University of Washington in St. Louis, “More women die from [heart] disease than men, and that has been true since 1984.” Unlike men, however, women are usually over 55 years old when heart disease begins to develop, while men may be as young as 45 years old.Women's Heart Disease RiskThe risks for heart disease are generally the same for both men and women. They include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, smoking, poor diet, and lack of physical exercise. However, with women, there is one extra risk factor, which may explain why women are more likely to suffer a heart attack once they reach the age of 55. At this point, the levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol rise in women, becoming higher on average than in men.Among all women, women of color have the highest risk and rates of heart disease.Heart Disease AwarenessIn 1997, in response to the lack of awareness among women regarding heart disease, the American Heart Association began promoting awareness of women’s heart health. Unfortunately, although the promotions helped more women become knowledgeable about heart disease, a lot of women who haven’t yet been reached.Much like the pink ribbon has become symbolic of breast cancer, the red dress is the symbol of heart disease and women. It was introduced as a symbol in 2002, when the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) along with other organizations, began sponsoring a national campaign called The Heart Truth.Although The Heart Truth campaign is geared towards women between the ages of 40 and 60, the sponsors are trying to reach younger women as well. Dr. Lawton said that although heart disease is less common in younger women, they are at risk too, and there's more they can do earlier in life to prevent later heart health issues. She once performed a bypass surgery on a woman who was only 32 years old, she said.In 2005, in order to target women of color, the NHLBI and its community partners, The Links, Inc., National Latina Health Network, and National Coalition of Pastors’ Spouses, developed The Heart Truth Women of Color initiative. The goal of this program is to reach out to women of color, making them aware of their risks through workshops and screening programs.The American Heart Association is also doing its part to raise awareness. Among their many programs is one called Go Red For Women, where you can register to receive a Go Red For Women red dress lapel pin and get information on how to prevent heart disease. By getting women to wear these pins, the AHA is hoping to raise more awareness about the effects of heart disease on women.You can play a part in raising awareness about heart disease among women, too.

What Women Need to Know About Thyroid Disorders,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/what-women-need-to-know-about-thyroid-disorders.aspx,"A blood test is critical to getting a proper read on how your thyroid is functioning.Lisa Clement couldn’t figure out why she was losing weight.Her hair was falling out, and the 27-year-old from Ohio was so tired, she sometimes crawled up the stairs to get to her apartment.It would be three years before an astute primary care physician thought to run a blood test to check out her thyroid hormone levels.Clement’s TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) levels were very low, while her other thyroid hormone levels (serum thyroxine, or T4, and triiodothyronine, or T3) were way up.Her doctor diagnosed her with hyperthyroidism, a thyroid disorder that affects 1 in 100 Americans, according to the National Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases Information Service.“I never suspected I had hyperthyroidism,” says Clement, who now has her condition under control with treatment. “I really didn’t know anything about it.”Your thyroid gland, located just below your neck in front of your larynx, secretes hormones through your bloodstream to every cell and every organ in your body.This tiny, 2-inch gland regulates your body temperature, keeps your brain thinking clearly, your heart pumping rhythmically, and basically maintains harmony among all organs in your body.When you have thyroid disease, your thyroid gland can either become overactive or underactive.If your thyroid doesn’t secrete enough hormones into your blood, you may suffer from hypothyroidism and a slowing down of bodily functions. This could cause more serious complications, like high cholesterol and heart trouble.Initial symptoms of hypothyroidism might include:On the flip side, if your thyroid secretes too many hormones, bodily functions will speed up, as it does in hyperthyroidism.Hyperthyroid symptoms could include:While a simple blood test can easily determine how much thyroid hormone you have in your blood, doctors often don't think to check TSH or other thyroid levels since the symptoms of a thyroid problem can mimic the symptoms of many other conditions.“Patients may have a variety of illnesses that can all cause fatigue and brittle hair,” says Stuart M. Weiss, MD, an endocrinologist and assistant professor at New York University in New York City. “But unless the physician gets the thyroid numbers to match the diagnosis, it’s difficult to blame the thyroid.”What makes matters worse is that doctors don’t always agree on how to read thyroid-related blood test results.Until the last six or seven years, doctors generally agreed that a TSH level of 0.5 to 5.0 was normal, and that anybody with those levels of TSH wouldn’t be considered to have a malfunctioning thyroid.But some endocrinologists worried that this broad interpretation of results meant that people with thyroid disorders were going undiagnosed and untreated. This includes a subset of thyroid patients who are said to have “subclinical thyroid disorder,” which generally means they appear to have no, or few, symptoms of hypothyroidism. Their T3 and T4 levels are normal, but their TSH levels are higher than normal.The National American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, wanting to catch a wider net of patients before they went on to develop serious complications, suggested narrowing the definition of “normal” TSH to between 0.3 and 3.0.The medical community continues to debate this issue. Some endocrinologists worry that a narrow interpretation of normal TSH level (for instance a TSH of less than 4) will result in perfectly healthy patients being treated for a disorder they don’t truly have. Others think that leaving the broader range of normal TSH may result in more people living without a proper diagnosis or treatment for hypothyroidism.While doctors continue to debate what comprises normal thyroid levels, some laboratories will still stamp a particular TSH reading ""high,"" while another calls the same reading as ""normal."" Weiss contends that the best diagnosis is one that takes into account not only the patient's blood test results, but a full personal history of symptoms and risk factors for hypo or hyperthyroidism.Risk factors for thyroid disease include:A clinical exam is important, too, as the physician looks for physical signs of thyroid problems, such as abnormalities in the appearance of the eyelids.This is the symptom that first flagged Clement's doctor to suspect hyperthyroidism. The doctor will palpate, or feel, your thyroid, looking for enlargement or thyroid nodules (which can very rarely be a sign of thyroid cancer).In addition to drawing blood, your doctor may also order an ultrasound exam of your thyroid to look for irregularities.RELATED: Have Depression or Anxiety? Get Your Thyroid CheckedIt is generally only after the doctor has conducted a full exam that a diagnosis can be made and treatment started.The treatment for hyperthyroidism includes “burning out” the thyroid with a one-time radioactive iodine pill and/or an antithyroid medication, such as Tapazole (methimazole) or PTU (propylthiouracil).Radioactive treatment can correct the problem when too much thyroid hormone is being made, but this often results in hypothyroidism afterwards.This will require the patient to take synthetic thyroid (thyroxine) pills to supply needed hormones, which is also the treatment for primary hypothyroidism.If you think you might have thyroid dysfunction, ask your primary care doctor to evaluate your symptoms and get a blood test. If you are a woman nearing menopause, it is especially important that you seek out an evaluation of your thyroid if you're experiencing symptoms.If you're not satisfied with the care you're receiving from your primary care doctor and still suspect a thyroid condition might be to blame for your symptoms, see an endocrinologist.

Signs of a Heart Attack for Women,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/signs-of-heart-attack-for-women.aspx,"Yet the signs and symptoms can be anything but clear. Further, men and women experience very different symptoms. Chest pain, breaking out in a cold sweat, nausea, upper body pain, shortness of breath, nausea, or dizziness are the kinds of symptoms you may associate with heart attacks for men and women. For women, none of these may happen. For women the signs tend to be some of the following: pressure in the chest, pain in the arms, back, neck, jaw, or stomach, shortness of breath without chest discomfort. Or none of the above.So what to do? And what to think about this enemy that cloaks itself in uncertainty?First, some statistics. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), in 2015 some 610, 000 people died of heart disease in the U.S. Further, the CDC says, almost two-thirds (64 percent) of women who die suddenly of coronary heart disease have no previous symptoms. Even if you have no symptoms, you may still be at risk for heart disease.Nevertheless, there are things you can do. And should do. We’ve all heard the preventive steps to ward off heart disease: don’t smoke; keep your cholesterol and blood pressure in the normal range; keep to a healthy weight; get plenty of exercise; tame stress; get plenty of sleep; control blood sugar if you have diabetes.But it’s true that you can do all that — and still be a person at risk. I know because I’m one of those people. I can check off every item on that checklist. Yet, despite the fact that heart disease runs in my family, it didn’t seem like an issue for me. Why worry?Here’s why: My story is classic. I wasn’t shoveling snow, but I was, after a March snowstorm, strenuously chipping ice and snow off my car for probably half an hour in the cold. When I finished, I got into the car to drive to my exercise class. But something didn’t feel right. I was not in pain, but I did feel pressure in my chest. I was sure it would go away momentarily. I arrived at my class — and the pressure was still there. Well, it was clear I shouldn’t exercise. But beyond that, what? I decided not to go to the emergency room, but to call my cardiologist. (I had a cardiologist because of slightly elevated blood pressure for a couple of years. Nothing to worry about, he said.) Thankfully, my cardiologist is a doctor who listens. He told me to come to his office immediately.The first thing he said was, “This is not a good story.” He did two standard heart tests: an electroencephalogram, or EKG, (normal) and an echocardiogram, or echo, (also normal). Nevertheless, he wanted me to go to an emergency room. Just to be sure. He directed me to a hospital with a good cardiac unit. (By then, the pressure in my chest had gone away.)The ER personnel went through their normal procedure: take blood, analyze for troponin level (proteins used as markers for various heart disorders). Distressingly, my troponin levels came back as slightly elevated. That, according to the ER doctor, usually meant a heart attack. So they checked me into the hospital.At 7 a.m. the next morning the cardiologist was in my hospital room. “I am really surprised,” he said. “You are not the right profile for a heart attack.” His conclusion: I needed an angiogram—an x-ray test using a special dye and camera to image the blood flow in arteries or veins to determine if there is blockage. The angiogram was performed later that day. The happy result: no blockage.The cardiologist called at 7 a.m. the next morning. “This is very good news,” he said. “You don’t have coronary artery disease.” My obvious question was: So what did happen? “Probably a spasm, a vasospasm, in your coronary artery,” he said. “You’re fine. If it occurs again, I’ll prescribe a medication to keep that from happening.”Guess what? It happened again, less than a week later, when I was just sitting on the couch watching the evening news. As promised, my cardiologist prescribed a medication that seems to have fixed both my tendency for vasospasm and brought my blood pressure into a consistently normal range. The condition, fairly rare, is often referred to as variant angina or Prinzmetal’s angina (for the cardiologist who described it as a variant form of angina pectoris in 1959).So, you might be wondering, how does my story have anything to do with you or your heart health?

Dealing With Hair Loss as a Woman,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/woman-dealing-with-hair-loss.aspx,"Hormones and other factors can lead women to lose their hair. And while thinning hair and balding can be more embarrassing for women than they are for men, in many cases, they are treatable conditions. Here’s what women need to know about hair loss.When you think of baldness and hair loss, you may conjure up visions of middle-aged men with shiny heads. And while approximately 85 percent of men have significantly thinning hair by 50, according the American Hair Loss Association (AHLA), 40 percent of those affected by hair loss (also known as alopecia) are women. More than 50 percent of women will experience noticeable hair loss, according to the Cleveland Clinic.In the past, balding and hair loss were dismissed as minor cosmetic problems not requiring treatment. But today, there’s more compassion for the emotional consequences of hair loss, particularly for women. In fact, hair loss can seriously affect a woman’s self-esteem and body image, according to a clinical review published in the journal The BMJ. “Women are much more affected socially by hair loss than men,” says Amy McMichael, MD, a professor of dermatology at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston Salem, North Carolina. “Women judge themselves harshly and have fewer coping mechanisms associated with their hair loss than men.”Many factors can cause women to lose their hair, from hormones to stress to going on or off birth control. Here are some of the main causes of hair loss in women:Hair loss can be devastating for women, so early intervention is key, advises Dr. McMichael. “As with most medical conditions, the key to controlling the hair loss cycle is to seek treatment early.""Fortunately, there are several treatment options available for hair loss and thinning hair. Your doctor may prescribe one or more of the following hair-loss treatments:New research offers hope for women (and men) suffering from hair loss. In a study published in May 2018 in the journal PLoS Biology, researchers used an osteoporosis drug to prolong the growth phase of the hair cycle and potentially treat hair loss.Other studies with mice have also been promising. In one series of experiments, researchers used an experimental compound to reverse hair loss in mice, according to a report published in July 2018 in the journal Scientific Reports. In a third study, published in July 2018 in the journal Cell Death and Disease, researchers discovered that turning off a mutant gene expression reversed hair loss in mice.Additional reporting by Jennifer D'Angelo Friedman.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.A new study found that taking hormonal contraceptives may have a small protective effect on severe cases of asthma in reproductive-age women.Lack of maternity care providers and no guaranteed maternity leave were cited as potential causes.How women value sex as they age, and why low-libido treatments are not available, were among the themes explored at the annual menopause meeting.The Supreme Court ruled that employers can refuse to offer birth control coverage as mandated by the Affordable Care Act if they have religious or moral...Count the Kicks, a prevention program, may spare some families from late pregnancy loss.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy."
Keep Your Feet Happy,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/keep-your-feet-happy.aspx,"From high heels to floppy sandals, women's feet can take a real beating. Get tips on how to keep your feet healthy and happy.The human foot is a delicate assembly of 26 bones — a quarter of all the bones in your body. But between squeezing your feet into high-heeled pumps or wearing sandals that offer little support or shock absorption, it's not unusual for a woman's feet to be mistreated. As a result, women often complain about foot pain. Fortunately, there are many ways to correct and prevent common foot problems.Foot Pain: An Unrecognized EpidemicWomen’s feet are the objects of much scrutiny. According to a recent survey from London, nearly half of men notice a woman’s feet when meeting her for the first time — and as many as a third judge her or analyze her personality based on what they see. It’s no wonder that more than 84 percent of American women have experienced “foot shame” at some point in time, or that over half are frequently embarrassed about their feet, as per the results of another survey by the American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA). Younger women, more concerned about style than comfort, are more affected than older women, the survey found.“It does affect women more than men, and it has a lot to do with cosmetic influences on women,” says Crystal Holmes, DPM, a podiatrist and clinical instructor of podiatry at the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor. “We also have more affection for shoes and shopping and fashion, and shoes play a big role in fashion, so having feet that might be considered cosmetically displeasing is an issue.”High heels are especially punishing on women’s feet, notes Dr. Holmes, and can cause a lot of foot pain. “If you have heels more than 2 inches high, it increases the forefoot pressure under the ball of your foot by seven times. So an average woman of 120 to 155 pounds with heels over 2 inches high has roughly 700 to 800 pounds of pressure in that area. So it makes sense that it should be painful.”Foot Pain: Common ComplaintsVisits to the podiatrists for foot pain often reveal the following problems:Foot Pain: No More Aching FeetFollow these steps to help prevent or correct foot problems:Holmes emphasizes that when it comes to getting shoes that fit well, women need to know that their foot size and shape can change over time as well as with weight changes. In general, feet get bigger over time, but they can get smaller if you lose weight. In addition, arthritis and trauma could change your foot size, as can pregnancy.“If you have a foot condition, seek medical advice,” advises Holmes. “Seek help early. Pain is not normal.

"So, You Think You Have PMS...",https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/what-is-pms.aspx,"Having one or two symptoms doesn't mean you're really experiencing PMS, and if you're struggling with intense period-related emotional issues, it could be another condition entirely. Here's how to tell the difference.Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a real condition that millions of women struggle with every month. But — brace yourself — a lot of ladies who think they've got PMS either have symptoms that are too mild or too severe to be PMS.According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 85 percent of women have at least one symptom of PMS during their monthly cycle, but most of these symptoms are mild and do not reflect a diagnosis of true PMS. And on the opposite end of the spectrum, women who experience severe emotional distress before their periods don't have PMS, but a more serious condition known as premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).PMS: What Is It, Really?While it's easy to assume that any bad mood that comes on right before your period is PMS, says Andrea Sikon, MD, a gynecologist at the Center for Specialized Women’s Health at Cleveland Clinic, PMS isn’t as common as many women think.“There are guidelines to define PMS, which consists of the recurrence of both physical and behavioral symptoms that interfere with some element of functioning during the second half of the menstrual cycle,” notes Dr. Sikon. “If one applies the strict clinical criteria, only 30 percent of women may have actual PMS.”There are some groups of women, however, who are more likely to experience PMS than others, including those who:PMS: What Are the Symptoms?While the symptoms of PMS vary from one woman to another, these are some of the more common manifestations:Is It PMS or PMDD?Only 3 to 8 percent of women have PMDD, or premenstrual dysphoric disorder, the more severe form of PMS, notes Sikon. According to the American Psychiatric Association DSM-IV criteria, PMS leads to physical as well as emotional symptoms whereas only emotional symptoms have to be present for a woman to be diagnosed with PMDD. “However, the symptoms must be prior to menses, resolve with the onset of menses, be disruptive to functioning, and be recurrent,” Sikon says.PMS: Medication and TreatmentOne of the first medications a gynecologist will consider in treating PMS is the birth control pill. Birth control pills can help regulate a woman's hormones and can offset the intensity of physical symptoms and mood swings. If birth control pills don’t resolve mood-related symptoms, it’s not unusual for gynecologists to recommend an antidepressant as well.Sikon says some women take offense at being offered an antidepressant, and may feel it means the doctor doesn’t think her symptoms are real, but it’s actually quite the opposite. “These antidepressant or anxiety meds likely work because changes in hormone levels alter neurotransmitters like serotonin, which mediate many things in the body, including pain and mood,” she explains. “As these medications help to influence serotonin levels, they can be used for many indications rather than just for depression. So if you’re doctor is giving you an antidepressant, it isn’t because she thinks your symptoms are ‘in your head.’ ” Sikon adds that some women may not need to take the antidepressant the entire month and can benefit simply by taking it in the two weeks before their period begins. Others, however, may find an antidepressant more effective if they take it every day.Sikon also recommends limiting caffeine intake to minimize PMS-related breast tenderness, and taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen) to diminish menstrual cramps and heavy bleeding.One widely touted treatment that may be useless? Vitamin B supplements. According to a recent article in Journal Watch Women's Health, the results of studies are inconsistent, and women should forgo supplements and focus instead on eating a well-balanced diet with plenty of foods high in B vitamins (green leafy vegetables, legumes, seafood).If you experience any PMS symptoms that interfere with your day-to-day life, it’s time to seek medical help. “Always talk to your doctor about any symptoms that seem out of the ordinary or are disruptive to your ability to get through your day,” advises Sikon.

The Top 5 Cancers Affecting Women,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/cancers-affecting-women-today.aspx,"Understand the risk factors associated with these five cancers and you'll be taking the first step to minimizing your personal risk.A cancer diagnosis is often linked to family medical history, lifestyle choices, or something in the environment. And while you can’t control your family history or your whole environment, healthy lifestyle habits such as a good diet, regular physical activity, weight control, and quitting smoking if you’re prone to lighting up are all within your control.“Risk factors are individualized, but it’s important to know that there are things you can do to lower your risk,” says Daniel McFarland, DO, a medical oncologist with the thoracic oncology service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City and an instructor in the center's department of medicine.Given that approximately 852,630 women are expected to be diagnosed with cancer in 2017 — and approximately 282,500 women are expected to die from the disease, according to estimates published in the “Cancer Facts and Figures 2017” report published by the American Cancer Society (ACS) — understanding your risk factors and learning what you can do to modify them is key.“Sometimes it comes down to the simple things, like reapplying sunscreen to prevent skin cancer if you’ve been outside for a while,” says Dr. McFarland. He recommends talking with your doctor about your own risk factors based on your family history and lifestyle. Knowing what you're up against can help you devise a plan for what screenings you may need to get (and when), what dietary changes could benefit you, and more — all personalized for you. “Modifying one thing might be helpful for one person but not necessarily helpful for someone else,” he says.Learn more about what might increase your risk for the top five cancers in women, and some steps you can take to reduce that risk.Breast cancer is expected to account for 30 percent of female cancer cases and 14 percent of the 282,500 female cancer deaths projected for 2017. A woman’s odds of getting breast cancer are 1 in 8.While there’s no one definitive way to prevent breast cancer — and many risk factors are beyond your control — being aware of the following most common risk factors can help you deal with those that are in your control.Lung and bronchus cancers are expected to account for 12 percent of female cancer cases and 25 percent of female cancer deaths in 2017. A woman’s odds of getting lung cancer are 1 in 17.A look at the percentages of deaths among people diagnosed with this form of cancer shows just how deadly lung cancer is. Though breast cancer is much more prevalent among women than lung cancer, the latter is responsible for many more deaths. Most striking is our ability to lower those numbers: 80 percent of all lung cancers in women (and 90 percent in men) might be avoided if people didn’t smoke. Smokers are 15 to 30 times more likely to get or die from lung cancer than nonsmokers, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Family history also plays a part.Other factors that increase lung cancer risk include exposure to:Besides following an exercise plan and a healthy diet, limiting your alcohol intake can also help lower lung cancer risk. And even if you are now a former smoker, if you smoked a pack of cigarettes a day for 30 years, guidelines recommend that you get a specialized low-dose CT scan of your chest annually to look for any signs of the disease, McFarland says.Radon can be a problem in your home if it’s able to seep through cracks in the walls or floors. Houses in the Northeast, southern Appalachia, the Midwest, and the northern plains tend to have higher levels of radon, but any home can be affected. Check the Environmental Protection Agency’s radon information page to see if you live in high-radon zone and to learn how you can test your home.Colon and rectal cancers account for 8 percent of all cancer cases and 8 percent of female cancer deaths. A woman’s odds of getting colon or rectal cancer are 1 in 24.While colon and rectal cancers can occur in young adults and teenagers, the majority of cases are diagnosed in adults ages 50 and over. The average age at which women are diagnosed with colon cancer is 72 (and for men, the average age at diagnosis is 68), according to the American Society for Clinical Oncology. Besides age, there are several other risk factors, some of which can be controlled:Early detection is a lifesaver, especially when it comes to colon and rectal cancers. It usually takes 10 to 15 years for abnormal cells to grow in the colon, which means that having regular colonoscopy screening tests to look for polyps and remove them before they become abnormal helps you avoid some of the most severe consequences of these cancers. Current guidelines recommend a colonoscopy at age 50, but talk with your doctor about your situation to see if you should get one sooner, McFarland advises.Multiple studies have also shown that getting enough calcium — either via diet or a supplement — was linked to lower risk of colorectal cancers.Limiting red and processed meats and increasing your fiber intake can also reduce risk. “In processed meats, the particles of food are so small that, literally as the food moves through the colon, the particles stay there,” says McFarland. And if the food has carcinogens, “you have greater exposure to carcinogens because they aren’t moving through the bowels as quickly,” he says. Fiber, on the other hand, quickly moves fecal matter through the colon, reducing your risk.Uterine cancer accounted for 7 percent of all cancer cases, and 4 percent of female cancer deaths. A woman’s odds of getting uterine cancer are 1 in 36.Uterine cancer (also known as endometrial cancer) is cancer in the lining of the uterus — the endometrium — and it’s the most common type of cancer that affects the female reproductive organs, making it more common than cervical cancer or ovarian cancers. Unlike cervical cancer, it’s not one of the gynecological cancers caused by HPV.Hormonal changes, particularly related to estrogen, play a significant role in your risk for uterine cancer; as with breast cancer, uterine cancer can feed on estrogen. Some things that can affect hormone levels and increase uterine cancer risk include: taking estrogen after menopause, birth control pills, a higher number of menstrual cycles (over a lifetime), past or present use of tamoxifen for breast cancer, never becoming pregnant, being obese, and having certain ovarian tumors or polycystic ovarian syndrome.Other factors that can increase a woman’s risk of developing uterine cancer include:Use of a nonhormonal intrauterine device (IUD) for birth control has been linked to a lower risk of uterine cancer.Thyroid cancer is expected to account for 5 percent of all cancer cases and 3 percent of all deaths in 2017. A woman’s odds of getting thyroid cancer are 1 in 57.As several of the risk factors for thyroid cancer are outside of our control, it may not be possible to prevent most of the cases of this disease, according to ACS. But it’s still important to know what these risk factors are so that if you’re at increased risk of the disease, you can get the tests you need to diagnose and treat potential tumors early.Factors that can increase thyroid cancer risk include:Make all the lifestyle improvements you can, most of which involve simple changes to your diet and exercise habits, and you'll increase your health and reduce your risk of cancers common to women.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.A new study found that taking hormonal contraceptives may have a small protective effect on severe cases of asthma in reproductive-age women.Lack of maternity care providers and no guaranteed maternity leave were cited as potential causes.How women value sex as they age, and why low-libido treatments are not available, were among the themes explored at the annual menopause meeting.The Supreme Court ruled that employers can refuse to offer birth control coverage as mandated by the Affordable Care Act if they have religious or moral...Count the Kicks, a prevention program, may spare some families from late pregnancy loss.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy."
Gain Control Over Sleeping Disorders,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/gain-control-over-sleeping-disorders.aspx,"It's not uncommon for women to have trouble sleeping. But there are tricks that can help you get a better night's sleep, and they don't have to involve prescription sleep aids.Sleep is so vital to health that many experts say adults need up to eight hours of sleep a night to feel energized the next day. But sleeping disorders ruin a good night’s sleep for many women.It’s not always that women don’t sleep enough, it’s that they don’t sleep well. Women sleep more lightly than men, so they’re more easily awakened … and less apt to wake up feeling refreshed.Sleeping Disorders: How They Affect YouSleeping disorders can sap women’s energy levels, affecting their emotions and even their weight, says Mary Susan Esther, MD, president of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), and a sleep medicine specialist with Charlotte Ear, Nose, and Throat Associates in Charlotte, N.C. “When you don’t sleep well, you don’t feel well, and it’s hard to think clearly. It can affect your concentration and your mood, and so you’re irritable and not as focused,” says Esther. “And it works in both directions — we know that mood symptoms like depression can cause sleeplessness.”Poor sleep habits can also slow down your metabolism.

Joint Pain and Women,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/joint-pain-and-women.aspx,"Women are not only more likely to suffer from joint pain, they also have a harder time finding the right treatmentEveryone gets the occasional ache or pain — a little soreness in the shoulder, a twinge in the knee — but research shows that women are more frequently and often more severely affected than men. The CDC estimates that from arthritis or chronic joint symptoms affect more than 70 million Americans, 41 million of whom are women. A number of factors contribute to this disparity: Women are more apt than men to have conditions that cause joint pain, experience hormone fluctuations that affect their vulnerability, and may not be physiologically equipped to deal with pain.Causes of Joint Pain in WomenOf the nearly 27 million Americans with osteoarthritis (AO), 60 percent are women. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an autoimmune disease, strikes approximately three times more women than men. Other autoimmune conditions that cause joint pain, such as lupus, scleroderma, and multiple sclerosis (MS), also hit women harder than men: Women are nine times more likely to develop lupus, three times more likely to have scleroderma, and twice as likely to suffer from MS. And fibromyalgia, a little understood condition that can cause joint pain, affects women eight times more frequently than men.The Estrogen-Joint Pain Connection""Women typically feel pain more intensively, more often, and in more parts of the body than men,"" says Tarvez Tucker, MD, a pain specialist and director of the Pain Clinic at the University of Kentucky Medical Center, in Lexington. Female hormones are believed to play a role in women's high vulnerability to pain. Many women with OA, RA, lupus, and fibromyalgia report an increase in joint pain just before or during their periods. This is likely because estrogen levels plummet right before menstruation and rise again after a woman's period is over. ""Estrogen is believed to be protective against pain,"" says Dr. Tucker. ""It peaks during pregnancy, probably to protect women from the pain of childbirth."" Some research shows that 80 percent of women with RA experience a remission of symptoms during pregnancy and a flare-up when estrogen dips during the postpartum period. Additionally, reproductive hormones are suspected as factors in the high incidence of autoimmune diseases in women since conditions such as RA and lupus are most common during the childbearing years.Women's Bodies and Joint PainHormones are only part of the picture, however. Female brains may be wired for pain. It's thought that endorphins, the body's natural painkillers, work more effectively in men than in women. ""Studies have found that females release less of the brain chemical dopamine in response to painful stimulation. Without dopamine, endorphins can't function effectively,"" says Patrick Wood, MD, a pain researcher at Louisiana State University, in Shreveport, and medical advisor to the National Fibromyalgia Association.Female structural differences may contribute to some kinds of joint pain, too. For example, women are more prone to osteoarthritis of the knee. One possible explanation: ""Women tend to be more limber and loose-jointed than men, so there's more movement in that area, increasing the risk that the kneecap will rub on the bones below it,"" notes Bruce Solitar, MD, a rheumatologist at the NYU Hospital for Joint Diseases, in New York City. This may lead to osteoarthritis symptoms in the knee area.Joint Pain Medication and WomenWomen react differently than men to some medications for relieving joint pain. For example, fluctuating hormone levels can reduce the amount of medicine circulating in the bloodstream, which means that women may need more of the standard dose. Plus, female digestive systems are slower, causing certain medications (like pain relievers) to take more time to pass through the digestive tract where they're absorbed more fully. And because pain sensitivity increases right before a woman's period, more pain-relieving medicine may be required at this time of the month. ""Women need to be aware of these factors, ask the right questions, and be persistent about getting an accurate diagnosis and proper treatment,"" says Dr. Tucker. By becoming educated about how joint pain affects them, women can increase the odds of finding relief and getting the best health care possible.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.A new study found that taking hormonal contraceptives may have a small protective effect on severe cases of asthma in reproductive-age women.Lack of maternity care providers and no guaranteed maternity leave were cited as potential causes.How women value sex as they age, and why low-libido treatments are not available, were among the themes explored at the annual menopause meeting.The Supreme Court ruled that employers can refuse to offer birth control coverage as mandated by the Affordable Care Act if they have religious or moral...Count the Kicks, a prevention program, may spare some families from late pregnancy loss.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy."
Help for Recurrent Yeast and Vaginal Infections,https://www.everydayhealth.com/yeast-infection/guide/,"Most women — and some men — will have a yeast infection at some point in their lives.A vaginal yeast infection is an infection resulting from the overgrowth of yeast — a type of fungus — of the genus Candida.Also called candidal vaginitis, vaginal candidiasis, or vulvovaginal candidiasis, yeast infections are most commonly caused by Candida albicans.It is easily treated with antifungal medication. If symptoms persist for more than a week, check with your doctor to rule out a more serious condition. (1,2)These habits may help yeast grow and lead to an infection:The most common symptoms of mild vaginal yeast infections include:More severe infections can cause redness, swelling, and cracks in the skin outside the vagina (the vulva). (1,2,3,4)Fungi of the genus Candida normally live on the skin and inside the body (mouth, throat, gut, and vagina) without causing health problems. Research suggests about 20 percent of women have candida in the vagina that doesn't cause infection. (1)There are many species of candida, at least 15 of which are known to cause infections if they multiply out of control. (5)In the United States, around 90 percent of vaginal yeast infections are caused by the species C. albicans. Most other cases are caused by C. glabrata. Less frequently, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei cause vaginal yeast infections. (6,7)Candida yeast cause an infection when something throws off the balance of microorganisms that live in and on your body, such as:Additionally, certain lifestyle habits may also promote the growth of Candida, including:Wearing clothing that keeps the vaginal area warm and moist, such as synthetic underwear, pajama bottoms, and tight jeans or spandex (3,8,9)Though it may be tempting to self-diagnose a vaginal yeast infection, since effective over-the-counter (OTC) treatments exist, experts recommend you see a doctor.Several other conditions — notably bacterial vaginosis (vaginal infection caused by bacteria), trichomoniasis (a sexually transmitted infection), and dermatitis (irritated skin) — can cause symptoms similar to yeast infections, making self-diagnosis difficult. In one study published in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology, only about 34 percent of women who purchased OTC antifungal medications accurately diagnosed themselves with a yeast infection. (3)You should especially see a doctor if:To diagnose a yeast infection, your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and medical history, perform a pelvic exam, and take a sample of vaginal discharge. A lab technician will examine the discharge to determine if there is an overgrowth of candida.Your doctor will make a diagnosis based on all the findings — a positive fungal culture alone does not mean you have a yeast infection, because women can have candida in their vagina without showing symptoms. (1,3)Most yeast infections clear up within a few days, depending on the severity of the infection and the medication used.But up to 8 percent of women develop recurrent or chronic yeast infections (at least four infections per year). These infections are typically due to non-albicans species, and may require different treatment. (3,7)Vaginal yeast infections are treated with over-the-counter or prescription antifungal creams, ointments, tablets, suppositories, or oral medications. You will need to take the medication for 1 to 7 days, depending on which medication you are using.OTC and prescription drugs that may be used include:If you have recurrent yeast infections, you may require multiple doses of fluconazole in the first week of infection, followed by at least six months of maintenance therapy (periodic fluconazole doses depending on the presence of symptoms). (11,12)Can home remedies and natural cures help treat and prevent vaginal yeast infections? Many women wonder what else they can do to deal with yeast problems. Despite the documented effectiveness of over-the-counter products and prescription medication for vaginal yeast infections, some women prefer to treat their ailments with natural or home remedies.Home remedies for vaginal yeast infections include:While they are very popular, the effectiveness of home remedies for treating and preventing yeast infections is not very well known or understood.Some remedies, at least, appear to be helpful for vaginal yeast infections, though more research is needed. For example, using probiotics as an adjuvant therapy could help cure yeast infections, but the quality of evidence is low or very low, according to a review published in November 2017 in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (16).And boric acid, at least, is recommended for the treatment of non-albicans species. (12)Yeast infections are not considered sexually transmitted infections (STIs), as most are not transmitted person to person and they can occur in people who have never had sex. But having sex with a vaginal yeast infection can be, well, complicated.There are a number of reasons you may want to wait until your infection clears to have sex:While the infections are not dangerous, they are uncomfortable and annoying enough that women may want to help prevent them. Risk-reducing steps include: (17)Left untreated, vaginal yeast infections may cause a number of different complications, including:About 70 to 75 percent of women will get a vaginal yeast infection at least once in their lives. And 50 percent of these women will experience more than one infection. (6,17)What's more, 5 to 8 percent of women experience recurrent or chronic yeast infections, and come down with four or more yeast infections in a single year. (17)Vaginal yeast infection is the second most common type of vaginal infection, after bacterial vaginal infection, in the United States. It results in 1.4 million outpatient visits a year. (1)Candida yeast colonizes the vagina of at least 20 percent of all women — and 30 percent of all pregnant women.Research suggests that vulvovaginal candidiasis is especially common among pregnant women; because of this, the infection is sometimes considered a complication of pregnancy.Both the increased candida colonization and yeast infection rates during pregnancy appear to be caused by several pregnancy-related factors, including increased estrogen levels, reduced immunity, and increased concentrations of sugar (a food source for yeast) in vaginal secretions. (18)The symptoms and severity of yeast infections are no different during pregnancy, but treatment varies slightly.Applying a topical azole for seven days is the recommended treatment for yeast infections during pregnancy; oral azoles have not been proved safe for pregnant women.In fact, research published in January 2016 in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) suggests oral azoles increase a pregnant woman's risk of spontaneous abortion. (19)Vaginal yeast infections are also considered a complication of type 2 diabetes, as the metabolic disease makes you more susceptible to the infection.Diabetes mellitus also makes you more prone to infections by the azole-resistant species of yeast C. glabrata.If your diabetes is uncontrolled, you'll have high levels of sugar in your blood, which also affects the levels of sugar in other areas of your body. Specifically, the mucous membrane in the vagina and vulva becomes saturated with sugar, allowing Candida to rapidly reproduce.A diet high in refined sugars may contribute to a diabetic woman's risk of yeast infection. (6)Though the term ""yeast infection"" is most often used to refer to a vaginal infection, it also applies to other types of candidiasis.A yeast infection of the mouth and throat is called thrush, or oropharyngeal candidiasis. (20)When a yeast infection affects the esophagus (tube connecting the throat and stomach), it's called esophageal candidiasis, or Candida esophagitis. (5)A yeast infection of the skin — which typically occurs in warm, moist areas, such as the armpits and groin — is called cutaneous candidiasis. (21)And if candida gets into the bloodstream, such as from using a contaminated intravenous catheter or as a complication of thrush, the yeast can cause a deadly infection called invasive candidiasis. Here, it enters your bloodstream and travels to other parts of your body, including your lungs, liver, and heart valves.It can cause infection or inflammation in various body parts, such as meningitis (infection of the membranes of the brain), esophagitis (esophagus), endophthalmitis (eyes), endocarditis (heart), urinary tract infections (UTIs), and arthritis (joints). (7,22)Candida can cause an infection of the bloodstream itself, called candidemia. (23)Invasive candidiasis most frequently affects people who are critically ill and in intensive care units, such as from yeast that travels to the bloodstream from the gut, or leakage after abdominal surgery. (24)Doctors typically treat the infection with antifungal medication, but up to 40 percent of people with invasive candidiasis die regardless of treatment. (25)Additionally, men can get yeast infections in their genitals (candidal balanitis), mouths, and other areas.For more go-tos on preventing, diagnosing, and, of course, treating yeast infections, here are some additional sources of information that can help.Mayo ClinicThe Mayo Clinic is a well-respected, integrated clinical practice, education, and research institution that prides itself on offering the most up-to-date medical information to the public.

When to Call Your Gynecologist,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/signs-you-need-to-visit-your-gynecologist.aspx,"With pelvic pain and skipped periods, it's better to be safe than sorry. Your body could be trying to tell you something.With the news that insurance companies will now be required to cover preventive health-care measures for women — including birth control, HPV screenings, and HIV counseling — it’s easier than ever to schedule regular checkups with your gynecologist.Prevention is your best defense against future health problems, but you can’t always predict when or what types of issues may arise. So how do you know if your symptoms warrant a trip to the doctor? These potentially serious signs are among several that call for a visit, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).Another potential source of regular pelvic pain is endometriosis, a common condition in which the lining of the uterus grows outside the organ. “Endometriosis starts with pain during the menstrual cycle and can progress to become an ‘all the time’ pain as endometrial cells grow outside the uterus,” says Stephen Weiss, MD, MPH, Assistant Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. The endometrial tissue bleeds during menstruation and can cause terrible pelvic pain. “There is no cure for endometriosis, but anything that makes periods shorter, lighter, or nonexistent can provide symptom relief,” says Weiss. One option is birth control pills, especially a brand called Seasonale, which limits menstrual periods to four times a year. Another choice is the drug Lupron (leuprolide), which lowers estrogen levels and can slow the growth of endometriosis. Your treatment will depend on how bad the pain is and whether you plan on getting pregnant. In addition to causing pelvic pain, the condition can lead to trouble having a baby. “There is no proof that early endometriosis is a cause of infertility, but high stage endometriosis can lead to fertility problems,” says Weiss.When to See the Gynecologist: ResourcesExperts say females who are sexually active and/or who are over 21 (whichever comes first) should see their gynecologist yearly for routine checkups and screenings.

What Is Endometriosis?,https://www.everydayhealth.com/endometriosis/guide/,"Endometriosis is a condition that can cause pelvic pain and difficulty getting pregnant.Endometriosis is a condition in which endometrial-like tissue grows outside the uterus on other organs, such as the ovaries, fallopian tubes, bowel, and outside walls of the uterus. Rarely, it can end up as far afield as the kidneys, bladder, or lungs. (1,2)Some women with endometriosis experience severe pelvic pain that can interfere with everyday activities such as bowel movements, urination, and sexual intercourse, and can worsen during menstruation.Talk to your doctor if you're experiencing any of these symptoms. There's no cure for endometriosis at this time, but treatment may help reduce pain or increase your chances of getting pregnant. (1,2,3)Pain associated with endometriosis can vary widely from patient to patient. Some women experience no symptoms; others experience severe pelvic pain or pressure. The first sign or symptom for others is having difficulty getting pregnant.Tamar Seckin, MD, an endometriosis specialist and the author of The Doctor Will See You Now: Recognizing and Treating Endometriosis, writes that your pain might relate to these areas:Endometriosis symptoms may include heavy or painful periods, pain in the intestines or lower abdomen, spotting or bleeding between menstrual periods, fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, and nausea or distension, especially during menstruation.Learn More About the Signs and Symptoms of EndometriosisEvery person with endo has their own story. Here are three of them — and these women didn’t hold back.Groups such as the Endometriosis Foundation of America, estimate that it takes many women as long as a ten years to get a proper endometriosis diagnosis. Part of the problem, according to the Endometriosis Foundation of America, is that many physicians, including gynecologists, don’t have special training in endometriosis. (1).If you suspect you have endometriosis, it is critical that you find a healthcare provider who is knowledgeable and experienced in handling it. Ask around. If you don't know anyone living with it, look for referrals from other women with endometriosis in online forums or patient support groups such as those at Endometriosis.org and Endo-Resolved.Learn More About How to Find an Endometriosis SpecialistExperts aren’t sure exactly what causes endometriosis, but they have several theories about contributing factors or risk factors: (4)Other factors that may increase your risk of developing endometriosis include the following: (1,2,4)Diagnosing endometriosis is not easy. The process requires laparoscopic surgery, in which a doctor removes a sample of tissue, typically via a woman’s navel, and performs a biopsy.It may be tempting for a woman or her doctor to try medications before surgery, but an improvement in symptoms does not equal a proper diagnosis. (1,4)Learn More About Diagnosing Endometriosis: Tests and Screenings, Early Diagnosis, and Your DoctorsAdvocacy groups estimate that it takes as long as 10 years for many women to get a proper endometriosis diagnosis. Part of the problem, according to patient advocates, is that many physicians, including gynecologists, don’t have special training in endometriosis. (1)You can help avoid diagnosis delays by seeking out an endometriosis specialist.Compared with doctors who are less familiar with the disease, endometriosis experts are more likely to spot and treat the disease quickly.Early diagnosis and treatment is especially important because untreated disease will not go away. Without comprehensive treatment, endometriosis can cause chronic pain as well as  scar tissue and infertility.Currently, there is no cure for endometriosis, but catching it early and fully excising the disease will likely prevent advanced, deeply infiltrative endometriosis.RELATED: Unrecognized Endometriosis: Despite 40 Years of Severe Pain Misdiagnosed as IBS, This Woman Didn't Give UpThe symptoms of endometriosis can easily be confused with other conditions, so it is important to see your gynecologist or a specialist to obtain a correct diagnosis. The pelvic pain you feel could also be related to these conditions: (5,6)It may be surprising to hear that hip pain in women is not only caused by arthritis and bursitis. In truth, gynecological issues such as endometriosis can cause pelvic tenderness that some women identify as hip pain.An endometrioma is a cyst that forms in the ovary when endometrial-like tissue grows there; the cyst contains old menstrual blood that looks like liquid chocolate — which is why these are often referred to as chocolate cysts.It sounds dramatic, but it's true: Surgery is required to confirm an endometriosis diagnosis.Fortunately, surgery to diagnose and treat endometriosis can be done laparoscopically. Laparoscopic surgery is considered minimally invasive because the procedure avoids open surgery.While a woman is under general anesthesia, a thin tube with a video camera is inserted into the pelvis through a cut near the navel. The tube also contains surgical instruments. It lights up the internal cavity so the surgeon can see while using the instruments to remove a sample for a biopsy or excising endometriosis lesions.Among other factors, appropriate post-op treatments depend on the woman's age, the severity of symptoms, and if or when pregnancy may be desired. Natural menopause may also serve to treat endometriosis, since it brings an end to the menstrual cycle.Can these classification systems help in the care and treatment of this disease?Endometriosis is considered a chronic condition; it is a disease for which there is no cure.While endometriosis cannot be totally eradicated, patients can find a significant reduction of painful symptoms — and possibly even complete relief — through traditional and nontraditional treatments as well as diet and lifestyle modifications.The severity of the disease is not related to the degree of pain. You can have a very early case and feel pain much worse than another woman whose disease is much more advanced. (8) The level of pain depends on several things:There are several treatments available to help reduce the pain and discomfort related to endometriosis.As with other chronic conditions that can't be cured, early endometriosis diagnosis and treatment is key. Catching the disease early and fully excising it can help prevent advanced, deeply infiltrative endometriosis.Endometriosis is still not well understood, and experts are still learning how one case differs from another, and why that matters. To help with the diagnosis and treatment of the disease, various organizations have developed different ways of categorizing it.Several of the following factors are used to classify endometriosis:Learn More About the Types and Stages of EndometriosisIn superficial cases of endometriosis, adhesions appear on the surface of organs; deep infiltrating endometriosis, on the other hand, is invasive, growing into the peritoneal tissues of the pelvic organ.Learn More About Deep Infiltrating Endometriosis: Causes, Symptoms, Treatment, and MoreJoin the hundreds of women — plus doctors, nurses, physical therapists, and others — who have shared their best tips for living with endometriosis. Read them all on Tippi.While the disease cannot be totally eradicated, women with endometriosis can reduce the pain and other symptoms significantly through these actions:Among other factors, appropriate treatments depend on age, the severity of symptoms, and if or when pregnancy may be desired.Don’t delay talking to your doctor about pelvic or lower abdominal pain or bad periods. You don’t have to endure these symptoms, and getting treated can help improve your overall health and quality of life.

Almost 40 percent of women with fertility problems have difficulty due to these conditions: (9)Nonetheless, it’s still possible to get pregnant with endometriosis. Hormone treatments or surgery to remove some of the endometrial-like tissue may help. (4,5,9)A number of other health conditions seem more common in women with endometriosis, but researchers are not quite sure how (or whether) these health problems are linked: (5,6)Endometriosis can cause pain, sometimes very severe discomfort, during or after sexual penetration or orgasm. It can be difficult to seek treatment for this sensitive problem.Painful sex, coupled with the anticipatory fear of that pain, can be a big turnoff.Unfortunately, many women are too embarrassed to talk with their physician about the problem, or they think there is nothing that can be done and try to ignore it or live with it. Some women are told that their pain is psychological or somehow less than real.The truth is that women with endometriosis don’t have to live with pain that interferes with intimacy or sexual relationships. Treatments are available, and sex doesn’t have to hurt.Learn More About Endometriosis and Severe Sex PainPerhaps even more elusive than endometriosis, bowel endometriosis can be tricky to detect.Bowel endometriosis, often misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome, occurs when endometriosis lesions grow on the peritoneum (the membrane lining the inside of the abdomen and covering the abdominal organs), the rectum, the intestines, and other deeper bowel levels.Learn More About Bowel EndometriosisThe risk of miscarriage may be higher with endometriosis, but the data is not conclusive. The evidence on this subject is mixed; some studies have found an increased risk of miscarriage among women with endometriosis. Experts don’t understand the link; whether the increased risk is related to endometriosis-caused inflammation in the uterus, dysfunctional uterine contractions, or another factor isn’t clearRELATED: The Question of Which to Treat First: Endometriosis or Fertility Problems?Fertility can be at risk when endometriosis lesions get in the way of the normal functioning of reproductive organs. Endometrial-like tissue that forms around the ovaries, for example, can keep eggs from being released.Although it can be challenging, many women with endometriosis eventually get pregnant.Learn More About Pregnancy and EndometriosisWhile endometriosis is considered a common condition, it's difficult to know for sure how many women have it, because some women have no symptoms. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists estimates that endometriosis affects about 1 in 10 women of reproductive age in the United States. (3)That's about 5 million women. Endometriosis is most common in women in their thirties and forties, but it can happen to any woman after menarch, which is their first period.Fact: Any woman or girl who gets her period can get endometriosis. You are at a higher risk if you have never had children, have menstrual periods that last longer than a week, have short menstrual cycles, have a family history, or have a medical condition that is blocking menstrual blood flow. (10)Fact: Pain can occur at any point during your monthly cycle, although it may feel worse during menstruation. (1,11,12)Fact: Your pain level is not related to the extent of endometriosis: You can have great pain with a mild case, and vice versa. (11)Fact: While 30 to 40 percent of women with the disease have fertility problems, they can be treated successfully with hormone therapy and surgery. (6,12)Fact: Endometriosis and the endometrium are not identical. Endometrial-like tissue grows outside the uterus but not the endometrium itself.

You used to have to do this with a calendar and pen, but now many great period-tracking apps make the job easy.RELATED: Some Fertility-Tracker Apps Help Women Find Fertile WindowIf you prefer to calculate your period the old-fashioned way, you’ll want to mark on a calendar the first day of bleeding with, for example, a slash or check mark, says Marjan Attaran, MD, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.The length of your cycle is measured from that day to the first day of your next period, Dr. Attaran explains. For most women, the average cycle is 28 days, although anything from 21 to 35 days is considered normal in adult women.RELATED: Is It Safe to Have Sex During Your Period?Knowing your cycle length is beneficial for a number of reasons. For women trying to conceive, understanding the timing of your cycle is valuable for determining the time you are most likely to get pregnant.Women are considered fertile when an egg has been released from the ovaries and is able to be joined by a man’s sperm. Because of how long both the egg and the sperm survive inside a woman’s fallopian tubes, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecology says you can become pregnant if you have sex anywhere from five days before ovulation until one day after.Generally, ovulation is said to occur about 14 days before the start of your next menstrual period. But every woman and every cycle are different. Knowing when you might really be ovulating and having intercourse around that time can enhance your odds of getting pregnant.RELATED: National Period Day Is October 19Weschler cautions that monitoring only the timing of your menstrual cycle, as some apps do, doesn’t give you enough information to accurately predict your future ovulation. The most accurate tracking apps include additional markers like basal body temperature (BBT), changes in cervical fluid, ovulatory pain, and the like, she says.In addition to period-tracking apps, a good way to monitor ovulation is with an ovulation predictor kit, which you can buy in the drug store. This uses hormones to most accurately tell you when you have ovulated.For women trying to avoid pregnancy who have very regular cycles, the fertility awareness method (FAM) is used by some women as a means of birth control. The idea is to avoid sex during the time in your cycle when you are most likely to conceive.However, Attaran cautions, this isn’t foolproof and “will definitely not work for people who have irregular periods.” For these reasons, it is not recommended as a way of preventing pregnancy, she says.RELATED: Real Women Tout Their Go-To Period Products“As the technology stands now, tracking should never be used as a sole method of birth control,” Weschler says, including with her own app, OvaGraph.This is because so many factors influence ovulation from one month to the next.A study published online in July 2019 in the journal Nature Digital Medicine found that women using tracking apps find they often do not ovulate at the exact midpoint of their cycle.Other research presented at a technology conference in May 2017 found that, when writing their reviews of the tracking app they used, women often cited unhappiness with inaccurate predictions. The scientists speculate this may be because the app didn’t account for factors that can throw off your cycle, like recently giving birth or approaching menopause.So while an article published in March 2016 in Global Health: Science and Practice called FAM an effective modern contraceptive, other experts point out that the method has a much lower effectiveness rate than the most reliable methods, such as intrauterine devices or contraceptive implants. In fact, the Department of Health and Human Services says about 25 percent of couples who use FAM may become pregnant.Because it is difficult to know exactly when you ovulate, to most successfully prevent pregnancy it is best to use an additional type of birth control, even if you are closely monitoring your periods.In addition to fertility concerns, charting your menstrual cycle is a good way to identify other gynecological health issues you may not be aware of, Weschler says.For example, a change in your cycle might suggest that you have fibroids, a vaginal infection, pelvic inflammatory disease, or endometriosis. In rare cases, it can be a flag for endometrial cancer.Tracking what happens in your body each month also helps your doctor diagnose the reason you are not getting pregnant when you want to, since it can reveal if you are not ovulating, if you are having a short second part (luteal phase) of your cycle, or even if you have polycystic ovary syndrome or another hormone imbalance, Weschler says.What’s more, tracking problems with your period is important because bad periods are not something you need to suffer through. If the next time you see your doctor you point out painful cramps or long bleeding days you have tracked, they may be able to suggest lifestyle changes or medicines to make things better for you.Finally, tracking your period can help you plan your life. Knowing when to expect your period means you won’t be caught without sanitary products or in your nicest white pants. It can also help you decide the best days to go on vacation or host that party, when you won’t be suffering from cramps.The best way to track your period really means the best way for you. This partly depends on what you want the information for and on your personal preference for an app’s function and design.Tracking your monthly cycle to try to get pregnant, for example, requires different features than if you want to assess your PMS. And whether you love or hate designs that go all feminine with pink colors and lots of curlicues is a matter of taste.Some privacy advocates have raised concerns about all the data you input in a period tracker and the potential for that data to be misused.Consumer Reports notes that period-tracking apps gather a lot of intimate information — about your sex life, whether you are trying to have a baby, if you engage in unprotected sex, have experienced a miscarriage, are approaching menopause — that could potentially be sold to third parties for marketing or other purposes.Having your personal health information out there may have serious repercussions, Consumer Reports cautions, such as whether and how much you pay for life insurance, or whether your employer discriminates against you.If an app lets you opt out of sharing your data (typically buried in the fine print), always do so, Consumer Reports says.Fortunately, there are many tools available to help you track your periods. Everyday Health examined a number of them and selected some favorites.Spot On From Planned ParenthoodBest For Monitoring all forms of birth control and identifying menstrual symptomsWhat It Does If you miss a birth control pill or don’t know when your next Depo-Provera shot is due, this app not only reminds you, it helps you figure out when backup methods are required if you get off course. Since the app is from Planned Parenthood, the comprehensive birth control info is top-notch.

Amenorrhea: What Causes Missed Periods?,https://www.everydayhealth.com/amenorrhea/guide/,"Amenorrhea is the medical term for the absence of a menstrual period. In teenage girls, it describes someone who has not gotten her first period by age 16. For women who have previously menstruated, it refers to the absence of more than three consectutive menstrual cycles. (1)Amenorrhea is not a disease, but in some cases, it may be a symptom of another condition. It can occur in healthy women when they are pregnant, breastfeeding, on certain contraceptives, or experiencing the skipped periods in the time before menopause, known as perimenopause.But in other women, amenorrhea can be a signal of trouble, especially if the missed menstruation appears with other symptoms. (1)Doctors divide amenorrhea into two types. Primary amenorrhea refers to a condition in a girl who has never menstruated by the age of 16, or sometimes 14.Secondary amenorrhea generally refers to three months of missed periods, or sometimes fewer, in a woman who previously had a normal cycle. (2)The absence of menstrual bleeding is labeled “amenorrhea.” But in some cases it is accompanied by other symptoms, indicating an underlying condition. For instance, women may have excess facial hair, headaches, hair loss, vision changes, or other symptoms in addition to the lack of a period. When this is the case, it is especially important to be checked by your healthcare provider. (1)Some women have very light periods that may not last long. If there is any bleeding, this is not considered amenorrhea.RELATED: Is Your Period Normal?Amenorrhea naturally occurs when a woman is pregnant or breastfeeding. Women who are on certain contraceptives or who have entered perimenopause, the years before their period ceases, may also experience months when they don’t get a menstrual period.In other women, amenorrhea is a sign of disruption in the hormonal system in the body. This may be due to certain behaviors, such as excessively exercising, having an eating disorder, or experiencing significant stress. Typically when the behaviors are reversed, the menstrual period will return. (3)Use (or abuse) of certain medications, including antipsychotics or drugs to treat certain cancers, can also stop your period for a time. (4)Sometimes the dysfunction occurs for other reasons. Hormonal issues can stop menstruation in a previously regular woman, or it can be the cause of primary amenorrhea, where the menstrual period hasn’t yet begun.Common hormonal problems causing amenorrhea include:Occasionally, primary amenorrhea results from a congenital anatomic abnormality of the reproductive system or from a genetic condition, such as fragile x syndrome. (3)A diagnosis of amenorrhea begins with your answering questions of your healthcare provider, including about your medical history, eating and exercise habits, and any medicines or supplements you may be taking. (5)You’ll also want to report about your typical menstrual cycle, including how long it has been since your last period. This is why it’s smart for all women to regularly keep track of their cycle, either using a calendar or a period tracking app designed especially for this purpose.You will also have a pelvic exam to check for physical defects. If birth defects are suspected in a teen with primary amenorrhea, a pelvic ultrasound might be performed.Generally blood tests are also done, including a pregnancy test as well as those that measure a variety of hormones such as estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), lutenizing hormone (LH), thyroid hormones, and others. (5)If these tests do not uncover the cause of the amenorrhea, a head CT scan or MRI may be ordered to look for a tumor.RELATED: How Keeping a Period Diary Helps Your HealthOnce the cause of the amenorrhea has been identified and treated, the menstrual period should return.Sometimes it requires stopping behaviors that are causing the lack of period, such as exercising excessively, being too thin or obese, or experiencing too much stress. (4)Contraceptives may also result in amenorrhea. This is not dangerous, and your period will typically return about three months after you stop taking or using them. (3)RELATED: Speaking Menstruation: A Glossary of Terms Used to Describe Symptoms, Tests, Treatments, and MoreBecause many different conditions can be behind your missed periods, treatment varies depending on the cause. This ranges from medication, behavioral changes, and sometimes surgery.Surgery for amenorrhea is uncommon but may be recommended in certain situations.When unhealthy lifestyle factors bring on amenorrhea, shifting to a healthier way of life can bring a regular cycle back. (6)To best regulate your menstrual cycle, maintain a healthy body weight and do a proper amount of exercise. (2)If you experience symptoms of any conditions known to cause amenorrhea, you’ll want to see your healthcare professional right away to prevent the disease from worsening and bringing on a long bout of amenorrhea.Going without a period may not signal a health problem. When there is no natural explanation, though, it can be a sign that your hormonal or reproductive system is not working properly. The risks of having amenorrhea vary, depending on a woman’s estrogen state; infertility or osteoporosis can occur from low estrogen, while endometrial cancer is related to high estrogen levels. (7,8)Several underlying conditions that include amenorrhea may cause significant complications.Untreated PCOS, for instance, may result in infertility. (9) Women with PCOS are often insulin resistant; their bodies can't use insulin effectively, which increases the risk for developing type 2 diabetes. (10)Unintended pregnancy can be a complication of amenorrhea if you are not carefully using birth control. It is still possible to get pregnant even when you are not having regular periods.

How to Maintain Your Fertility,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/maintaining-your-fertility.aspx,"Don't fall victim to common misconceptions about fertility. Here's what you need to know about your reproductive health.Many women spend much of their young adult lives trying not to get pregnant. But when it’s the right time for you to start your family, you want to know you’re doing everything you can to protect and enhance your fertility. And there are steps you can take to make getting pregnant easier.Getting Pregnant: Common Fertility MisconceptionsThe most common fertility misconception is that getting pregnant is an easy thing to do. “In school they taught you how to avoid getting pregnant, but nobody tells you how to increase your chances of conceiving,” says Amos Grunebaum, MD, an obstetrician-gynecologist based in New York City and medical director of a natural fertility supplement supplier. “Most people don’t realize that the average couple only has a 20 to 25 percent chance of achieving pregnancy each cycle.”Beyond the idea that pregnancy is an easy state to achieve, Dr. Grunebaum says that another common fertility misconception he sees is the idea that if there’s a problem, it’s the woman’s fault. “In reality, roughly half the causes of infertility are due to male factors, like low sperm count or low sperm motility,” he says.Getting Pregnant: Tips to Increase Your ChancesHe adds that while “fertility diets” can be useful, you don’t have to memorize any strange recipes or shopping lists to stick to a diet that can boost your fertility levels. Here are some basic guidelines:Avoid trans fats: According to data from the Nurses’ Health Study, trans fats can deter ovulation and conception. Even just four grams a day — less than the average American gets regularly — may have a negative effect on fertility. Trans fats are common in fried and processed foods, so skip the drive-thru and the snack packs at the grocery store, and go with whole, natural foods for the biggest nutrient boost. “In general, you want to eat healthy, natural foods that are rich in nutrients, antioxidants, and folic acid,” according to Grunebaum. “Good examples are citrus fruits, green leafy vegetables, broccoli, and fortified cereals.”Pick plant protein over animal: The Nurses’ Health Study also found that women who ate the most animal protein — such as beef, chicken, and pork — were 39 percent more likely to have fertility issues than women who ate the least. However, the opposite was true for women who ate plant protein such as beans, tofu, and nuts.Eat slow carbs, not no carbs: Harvard researchers found that it’s not the quantity but the quality of carbs that influences fertility. For example, fast carbs, including white bread and potatoes, which your body digests quickly, can decrease your chances of conception, while slow carbs, such as brown rice and other whole grains, can improve your odds.Getting Pregnant: See Your GynecologistBefore trying to conceive, schedule an appointment with your gynecologist. “It’s a good idea to ensure that you’re going down the right path,” says Grunebaum. Even if you don’t visit a doctor when you first begin trying to have a baby, if you’re trying to conceive for six months or more and haven’t had success, Grunebaum says, it’s a good time to see a doctor to check for any fertility problems with you or your partner. “A good ob-gyn can teach you about how your cycle works, how best to predict ovulation, even what sexual positions are recommended to help you conceive,” he says.You should also take some time to get familiar with your body in your own home. If you don’t already, start tracking your cycle on a calendar so you can better predict your most fertile window, which, according to the National Institutes of Health, is somewhere between days 7 and 20. If you have an irregular cycle, consider picking up an ovulation prediction kit at your drug store. You can also use a special thermometer to track your basal body temperature (BBT), which rises after you ovulate and then stays at a higher-than-normal level until the end of your cycle.Getting Pregnant: Substances to Steer Clear OfObviously, maintaining a healthy lifestyle is of utmost importance when you’re trying to conceive. The first few weeks of pregnancy are the most critical, and much of this occurs before you even realize you may be pregnant. So during that time, it's best to steer clear of substances like:Grunebaum also advises that skipping your morning cup of coffee might help boost your fertility. “Caffeine can reduce the body’s ability to absorb iron and increase the potential for complications during pregnancy,” he says. In fact, researchers from the Netherlands found that more than four cups a day cut chances of conception by 26 percent. Grunebaum also recommends that women trying to conceive minimize stress to the best of their ability. “Exercise can provide stress relief, and there are a number of fertility yoga programs that are designed to help couples conceive,” he says.Fertility Levels: Getting TestedIf you’re trying to conceive and have not yet had success, a doctor may recommend having your fertility levels tested. Grunebaum says the most common fertility analysis is called the “Day 3 FSH Test.” This test measures the level of follicle stimulating hormone present in a woman’s body on the third day of her menstrual cycle. “It is essentially a way to measure the ovarian reserve, although even a low reserve does not necessarily mean one cannot get pregnant,” he says, adding there are also tests that measure hormones like estrogen and progesterone, which are key to a successful pregnancy.Your doctor may also need to rule out endometriosis, fibroids, pelvic inflammatory disease, and problems with your partner’s sperm production or mobility, all of which can cause fertility issues.“Don’t get discouraged if at first you don’t succeed,” Grunebaum says. “Take advantage of all the information and resources available for couples who are trying to conceive.”Learn more in the Everyday Health Women's Health Center.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.A new study found that taking hormonal contraceptives may have a small protective effect on severe cases of asthma in reproductive-age women.Lack of maternity care providers and no guaranteed maternity leave were cited as potential causes.How women value sex as they age, and why low-libido treatments are not available, were among the themes explored at the annual menopause meeting.The Supreme Court ruled that employers can refuse to offer birth control coverage as mandated by the Affordable Care Act if they have religious or moral...Count the Kicks, a prevention program, may spare some families from late pregnancy loss.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy."
What Are Ovarian Cysts?,https://www.everydayhealth.com/ovarian-cyst/guide/,"Most ovarian cysts disappear within a few months without treatment.An ovarian cyst is a pocket, filled with fluid or a semisolid material, that forms on or inside the ovaries.Many women will have an ovarian cyst at some point during their lives. Most ovarian cysts are not a cause for concern.One type of harmless cyst, called a functional cyst, occurs due to the normal function of the menstrual cycle.These cysts tend to shrink away on their own, usually within 60 days.When cysts aren't caused by the normal function of the menstrual cycle, they may be one of the following types of cysts:Dermoid cysts: These cysts form from cells that produce human eggs. They may contain tissue such as hair, skin, or teeth. They are rarely cancerous.These cysts can grow so large that they cause your ovary to twist or move out of its usual position. This is called ovarian torsion.Cystadenomas:  These cysts develop from ovarian tissue and may be filled with a watery liquid or a mucousy material. They can grow to be large.Endometriomas:  These cysts are caused by the condition endometriosis, in which uterine cells grow outside your uterus and can form a growth on your ovary.Smaller ovarian cysts tend to cause no symptoms.Larger cysts can cause:Cysts that rupture (break open) can cause serious symptoms.Typically, an ovarian cyst is found during a routine pelvic exam.When a gynecologist suspects the presence of an ovarian cyst, he or she may request an ultrasound, which uses sound waves to create images of internal organs.Most functional ovarian cysts disappear within a few months without treatment.In some cases, your doctor may prescribe a medication, such as birth control pills, to stop ovulation and prevent cysts from developing in the future.In certain severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove a cyst.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.A new study found that taking hormonal contraceptives may have a small protective effect on severe cases of asthma in reproductive-age women.Lack of maternity care providers and no guaranteed maternity leave were cited as potential causes.When it comes to uterine fibroids, for women of color, taking control of your health is one of the most important steps to getting proper care.Heavy periods are one of the hallmark signs of uterine fibroids, but determining the cause of your heavy menstrual bleeding and finding the right treatment...Experiencing extreme hot flashes and other symptoms isn’t just uncomfortable, it’s also a warning sign.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy."
The Importance of a Yearly Pap Smear,https://www.everydayhealth.com/sexual-health/pap-test.aspx,"Pap smears can detect abnormalities before they turn into cancer.Regular preventive care is one of the most important ways to maintain your health over time. If you wait to see a doctor only when you notice a problem, it may be too late.Cervical cancer screening is especially important for women’s health — but how and when it should be done has been the subject of some recent debate.Current guidelines from the American Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommend that women should have a Pap smear every two years starting at age 21. After age 30, you may decrease the frequency to every three years if you’ve had three normal Pap test results in a row and if your immune system has not been weakened by a virus or recent health condition.Other organizations, however, including the American Cancer Society, suggest that women over 30 should be screened using a combination of both the traditional Pap and the HPV (human papillomavirus) test — which, according to a recent study published in the journal Lancet Oncology, may detect abnormal cervical lesions earlier and more accurately than the Pap test alone.More research is needed to determine how the HPV test should be incorporated into our screening program, but experts say it’s not likely to replace the Pap anytime soon. For now, both ACOG and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force say Pap smears are a woman’s best bet for early detection of cervical cancer.“Pap smears can detect early precancerous changes on the cervix,” explains Johnathan Lancaster, MD, PhD, chair of the department of women’s oncology and director of the center for women’s oncology at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, in Tampa, Fl. “These changes can be easily treated, thus dramatically reducing the risk of progression to cervical cancer.”What Problems Can a Pap Smear Detect?“Pap smears are not designed to detect cervical cancer,” says Dr. Lancaster. “They are designed to detect cervical dysplasia, or precancerous changes [in the cervix].” When abnormal cells are detected by Pap smear, your doctor can take steps to figure out the culprit behind these changes and treat the condition before it turns into cancer.How Often Should I Have a Pap Smear?“Like all medical tests, Pap smears are not 100 percent accurate,” he says. “This reinforces the importance of having regular Paps, so that even if one Pap misses an early abnormal change, it’s likely to be picked up at the next Pap.”What if I Have an Abnormal Pap Smear?An abnormal Pap smear means abnormal cells have been identified on your cervix. Depending on the type of cells found, your doctor may recommend repeating the test in four to six months, Lancaster says. Other times, they may choose to perform a colposcopy in order to get a better look at the cervix and take tissue samples to biopsy so they can determine what types of cells are present.During a colposcopy, a thin tube with a very small camera attached to it is gently inserted into the vagina, up to your cervix. During a biopsy, your doctor removes a small piece of tissue from your cervix to analyze it under a microscope. The results of these tests can determine the nature of the problem and guide treatment.When Should I Start and Stop Getting Yearly Pap Smears?The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends women begin getting Pap smears within three years of the first time they have sexual intercourse, or by age 21, whichever comes first, says Lancaster.“Some women may discontinue Pap smears after age 65, but this needs to be a highly individualized decision based on risk factors and decided in conjunction with their gynecologist,” Lancaster says.How Should I Prepare for a Pap Smear?Lancaster says the presence of any substance in the vagina can lower the accuracy of a Pap smear. He recommends women avoid douching or engaging in sexual intercourse for two to three days prior to having a Pap smear to get more accurate results. Lancaster also says it’s preferable that women not be menstruating when having a Pap smear, since this too can interfere with the accuracy of the test.What Happens During a Pap Smear?Pap smears are generally painless and usually done during a pelvic exam. The doctor will position you on the exam table and insert a device called a speculum into your vagina; the speculum opens the vaginal area wider, giving the doctor a better view of the cervical area. The doctor will then swab your cervix with a brush or cotton swab to collect cells from its surface, and then send the cells off for analysis to see if there are any abnormal cells present.Although Pap smears can seem like an uncomfortable nuisance, they are critical to keeping women of all ages healthy.

Coping With Heavy Menstrual Bleeding,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/coping-with-heavy-menstrual-bleeding.aspx,"Heavy periods may be normal for you, or they could signal a medical condition that requires a visit to the doctor and prompt treatment.Menorrhagia is a condition in which a woman has heavy or prolonged periods during her regular monthly cycle. Such heavy menstrual bleeding can be inconvenient and uncomfortable, but it may also signal a more serious health problem.Contrary to what many think, each woman's menstrual cycle has its own unique timing and variation. While the average period occurs every 28 days and lasts for four days, fluctuations between 21 and 32 days are considered normal. Soaking through a sanitary pad or tampon every two to three hours is considered a heavy period. Likewise, prolonged periods are those that last for more than seven days.Menorrhagia: Underlying Health ConcernsA number of underlying issues can cause heavy menstrual bleeding, such as uterine fibroids, noncancerous tissues that grow in and around the uterine wall, explains Steven R. Goldstein, MD, obstetrician and gynecologist at the New York University Langone Medical Center and professor of obstetrics and gynecology at New York University School of Medicine. If you're dealing with menorrhagia, your doctor will need to rule out fibroids as a first step.Other conditions that can cause heavy menstrual bleeding include:Changes in lifestyle and eating habits, stress, excessive weight gain or loss, travel, intense exercise, and surgery or recent trauma can also all contribute to the onset of menorrhagia.For some women, even childbirth can be a cause. ""Sometimes heavy bleeding occurs after a woman has had a child, or several children,"" says Dr. Goldstein. ""Pregnancy causes the surface area of the uterus to expand, which means that after childbirth, there is twice as much surface area to shed through menstruation as before, hence the heavier bleeding than before childbirth.""Menorrhagia: When to See a SpecialistIt's common for periods to vary in duration and flow, so there is no need to rush to the doctor when one cycle is heavy. Goldstein suggests monitoring your periods and visiting a specialist after three unusually heavy or prolonged cycles.Your doctor may order certain tests to determine the specific cause of your menorrhagia, including:All of these are outpatient procedures, though some may require anesthesia. Test results are generally available within seven days.Menorrhagia: Treatment OptionsIf other medical conditions are ruled out and you still have menorrhagia, there are several options to consider. Talk to your doctor about whether any changes in lifestyle and eating habits can help reduce menstrual bleeding or if you should consider medical treatments, which have varying degrees of effectiveness and possible side effects. According to one study, oral progestogen pills are a common treatment for menorrhagia, and yet one of the least effective. Another study found it more effective to deliver hormones through an intrauterine device (IUD) that releases synthetic progestogen levonorgestrel hormone within the uterus. And a third found that using a simple over-the-counter NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug), such as ibuprofen and naproxen, can reduce menstrual blood loss by up to 60 percent.A newer option with results in the same range as NSAIDs is the drug tranexamic acid, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in late 2009. The first non-hormonal medication to be given the green light for menorrhagia, it targets a protein that helps blood to clot. Tranexamic acid does have some side effects; discuss all the pros and cons with your ob-gyn.In severe situations, you might want to ask about surgery, such as a hysterectomy to remove your uterus (after which childbearing is no longer possible). Another option is the less radical endometrial ablation, which removes the endometrial lining so that it no longer bleeds each month.

Treating Endometriosis,https://www.everydayhealth.com/endometriosis/guide/treatment/,"There is no cure for endometriosis, but treatment can help alleviate symptoms.Endometriosis is a chronic condition; at present time, there is no cure. Don’t let this make you lose hope! While the disease cannot be totally eradicated, women can find a significant reduction of painful symptoms — and in some cases, complete relief — through various traditional and nontraditional treatments as well as diet and lifestyle modifications. Appropriate endometriosis treatments depend on age, severity of symptoms and disease, and whether the woman wants to get pregnant.Related: What Is Deep Infiltrating Endometriosis? Causes, Symptoms, Treatment, and MoreThese are used for controlling pain by reducing inflammation or interrupting or suppressing menstruation:Usually, these procedures can be done without the need for open surgery. A thin tube with a video camera is inserted into the pelvis through a small incision near the navel. The tube also contains surgical instruments. It lights up the internal cavity so the surgeon can see and, with the instruments, excise lesions. You will receive general anesthesia.Usually, this can be done as outpatient surgery, but depending on the severity of the case, you may need to spend a night in the hospital.Related: Endometriosis Types and StagesJoin the hundreds of women — plus doctors, nurses, physical therapists, and others — who have shared their best tips for living with endometriosis.

Hormonal therapy will block conception, so you will want to take another path.Related: The Question of Which to Treat First: Endometriosis or Fertility Problems?Untreated endometriosis can have long-lasting effects, such as chronic pelvic pain; scar tissue, which can cause obstruction; and infertility. Rarely, endometriosis can contain cancer within it, said Leena S. Nathan, MD, an assistant clinical professor in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at UCLA Health in Westlake Village, California.Related: Unrecognized Endometriosis: Despite 40 Years of Severe Pain Misdiagnosed as IBS, This Woman Didn’t Give UpEndometriosis is a chronic condition that will recur unless the menstrual cycle is stopped. “After surgery, we commonly suppress recurrent endometriosis by starting continuous birth control pills. This is safe and effective. The goal is to avoid having a period, which can lead to further implants and bleeding within the pelvis,” said Dr. Nathan. This can be accomplished with hormonal IUDs and GnRH agonists and antagonists, all of which decrease or stop menstrual bleeding.The ultimate therapy would be a hysterectomy and removal of one or both ovaries. Menopause will also serve to treat endometriosis as the menstrual cycle has stopped.Watch what you eat! Certain foods can actually increase or lessen your risk of getting endometriosis, according to researchers. (3)If you already have endometriosis, diet is still an important factor. While studies have been inexact as to benefits, some experts believe certain diets will help reduce inflammation, estrogen in the body, and oxidative stress.Avoiding gluten seems to be the hot craze these days, but a very preliminary study found that some women did find symptom reduction by trying this diet approach. (5) Discuss with your physician to see if it is worth it for you as the studies so far have been very small and need further evaluation.Diet can help relieve bowel endometriosis symptoms. Tamar Seckin, MD, an endometriosis excision specialist and the author of The Doctor Will See You Now: Recognizing and Treating Endometriosis, recommends the FODMAP diet, which limits carbs and gluten. (This diet is also often prescribed for IBS patients.)Research published in March 2017 in Australian and New Zealand Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology suggests the low-FODMAP diet may help some women with endometriosis. Symptoms such as constipation and bloating may improve with the special diet.FODMAPs, an acronym, stands for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols. FODMAPs are carbohydrates or sugars that are found in foods. (But not all carbohydrates are FODMAPs.)The low-FODMAP diet restricts high-FODMAP foods such as certain fruits, vegetables, and wheat products, to help reduce symptoms like diarrhea, constipation, gas, and cramping.It is an elimination type diet, in which you dramatically restrict intake of high-FODMAP foods for a limited time and then reintroduce them systematically, to see what you can tolerate.Some supplements may interfere with medication you are taking (especially if you are on blood thinners), so run it by your physician before taking anything new. Again, the studies on these are not definitive and need more research:Caution: If you do decide to try alternative remedies, discuss your choices ahead of time with your physician. Some of these may not be right for your particular situation or may interfere with your medication. Also, the studies so far have used very small samples.Do not forgo your traditional therapy for an alternative route. You can create a complementary route together as a team with your doctor.Related: 5 Yoga Moves for Endometriosis and Pelvic Pain ReliefMaybe the physicians can’t see you right away or perhaps the visit will have to wait until you can travel to where they are.

What a Uterine Fibroid Diagnosis Means for Your Health,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/fibroids.aspx,"Fibroids are benign 99 percent of the time, but that doesn't mean they can always be ignored, especially if they're preventing you from getting pregnant or causing you pain.Uterine fibroids are growths that commonly develop on a woman's uterus, many times without causing any symptoms that would make her aware that they are present. But for some, fibroids can cause discomfort and heavy bleeding.Fibroids affect women of all backgrounds, often during their reproductive years, but to varying degrees, explains John F. Steege, MD, director of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, and director of the UNC Fibroid Care Clinic. For instance, African-American women are more likely to develop fibroids than white women and at an earlier age.Fibroids: More Annoying Than WorrisomeAlso known as leiomyomas or myomas, “each fibroid apparently arises from a single cell that has escaped the usual controls over growth,” explains Dr. Steege. Ranging in size from a grape to a small grapefruit, fibroids grow inside the uterus or uterine walls, or outside, but attached to, the uterus. Many women with fibroids have no symptoms and need no treatment.Fibroids can develop during a pregnancy without causing problems, although occasionally, some fibroids, particularly if they are large, can interfere with pregnancy or lead to miscarriages or infertility. Most fibroids shrink at menopause, but some grow so large that they press on other internal organs and have to be surgically removed.Fibroids can be the reason behind heavy vaginal bleeding and iron-deficiency anemia. Some fibroids attached to the uterus by a stem can get twisted, causing pain and fever.If you notice any of these symptoms, be sure to bring them to the attention of your ob/gyn:Regardless of size, “about 99.5 percent of fibroids are benign,” says Beth W. Rackow, MD, assistant professor in the department of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences at Yale University School of Medicine. Only very rarely does a fibroid become cancerous, Dr. Rackow adds.Fibroids: Interfering With Fertility“Some fibroids get diagnosed during an evaluation for infertility or recurrent pregnancy loss,” according to Rackow. Usually, diagnosis requires imaging tests to assess the fibroids’ number, size, and location.The type of fibroids that appear to cause the most problems, Rackow says, are those that form underneath a mucous membrane and jut [inwards] into the uterine cavity. This jutting sometimes “causes pregnancy failure and/or loss of fertility because it makes the uterine cavity abnormal and decreases the chance of pregnancy,” she explains.Fibroids within the uterine wall can also alter the uterine cavity, block the fallopian tubes, or displace the cervix, the narrow opening at the end of the uterus, near the vagina, Rackow says.Fibroids: Treatment OptionsHow, or even if, fibroids are treated depends on your age, the severity of your symptoms, and whether you hope to get pregnant in the future. Because medications that shrink fibroids interfere with fertility, surgery that preserves fertility is the usual treatment for younger women, Rackow says.Strategies for treating fibroids include:Because every case of fibroids is different and because your needs change at different times in your life, consulting with your ob/gyn will help you make the best choice for fibroid treatment.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.A new study found that taking hormonal contraceptives may have a small protective effect on severe cases of asthma in reproductive-age women.Lack of maternity care providers and no guaranteed maternity leave were cited as potential causes.How women value sex as they age, and why low-libido treatments are not available, were among the themes explored at the annual menopause meeting.The Supreme Court ruled that employers can refuse to offer birth control coverage as mandated by the Affordable Care Act if they have religious or moral...Count the Kicks, a prevention program, may spare some families from late pregnancy loss.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy."
Treating Fibroids Without Hysterectomy,https://www.everydayhealth.com/hysterectomy/uterus-sparing-treatment-options/,"A hysterectomy is a surgical operation to remove the uterus, the organ located in the female pelvis.During pregnancy, a fertilized egg implants itself in the lining of the uterus where the developing fetus is nourished prior to birth.Also known as the womb, the uterus is crucial for reproduction.After undergoing a hysterectomy, a woman cannot become pregnant.With the exception of certain gynecological cancers or more rarely a life-threatening situation, such as uncontrollable bleeding after childbirth, there are alternatives to treat every condition and symptom where a hysterectomy is an option.Options range from medications and hormone treatments to minimally invasive procedures. Since most hysterectomies are elective, a woman usually has time to discuss other means to manage symptoms that may be interfering with the quality of her day-to-day life.Fibroids are the No. 1 reason for hysterectomies in the United States. Fibroids, also known as leiomyomas or myomas are the most common tumors of the female reproductive systems. They are benign (noncancerous) and arise from the smooth muscle cells of the uterus. Some estimate that up to 80 percent of all women develop fibroids during their childbearing years. (1)Because they often cause no symptoms, fibroids are usually detected incidentally during a pelvic exam or a prenatal ultrasound. (2)Symptoms include heavy menstrual bleeding, prolonged menstrual periods (lasting more than a week), pelvic pain, frequent urination, low back pain, or painful intercourse.While symptoms often respond to medications or nonsurgical treatment, sometimes the symptoms are severe enough to consider a hysterectomy. Hysterectomy is the only permanent solution for uterine fibroids.Yes, you can “watch and wait” before treating fibroids. In the majority of cases, these tumors are asymptomatic and women only learn that have fibroids through a routine gynecological visit.Fibroid growth and the severity of symptoms are unpredictable and arbitrary — sometimes fibroids stay the same size or shrink on their own without any treatment at all. So, many women decide to “watch and wait” before turning to surgery, especially when symptoms are mild or nonexistent. When symptoms such as bleeding, pelvic pressure, and pain occur, it’s sometimes related to the location of the fibroids rather than their size or number.If you choose to treat the fibroids, you have several alternative options to a hysterectomy.These fibroid treatment options include:Other medications and treatments:Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), including ibuprofen and naproxen, manage pain but don’t decrease bleeding or shrink fibroids.Iron supplements Your doctor may suggest you take special vitamins if heavy bleeding due to fibroids is causing you to be anemic.Treatment for endometriosis can involve medication and/or surgery. As with fibroid treatment, a woman with endometriosis has some alternative options to a hysterectomy. Pain medications can help. And hormone therapy can be effective in reducing and eliminating the pain of endometriosis by slowing endometrial tissue growth and preventing new implants (lesions).The following more conservative options are available to help with symptoms of this often painful condition.Using laparoscopic techniques, surgeons can remove visible endometriosis and scar tissue through cutting (excising), burning, or lasering.Laparotomy is major abdominal surgery to remove the endometriosis patches.Another endometriosis treatment is presacral neurectomy, which severs the nerves connected to the uterus to relieve pain.Some women opt to watch and wait until reaching menopause when endometriosis growth can recede. However, even after menopause your body still produces estrogen, so while symptoms may lessen, they can persist.Adenomyosis, a condition which results in an enlarged uterus, painful periods, and abnormal bleeding, can be treated in much the same way as endometriosis with hormone medications (including birth control pills, IUD). Anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) can reduce menstrual blood flow and relieve pain.Women with these conditions may experience pelvic pressure, urinary incontinence, or difficulty making bowel movements. Alternatives to hysterectomy include:Depending on the condition causing the pain, treatment can include medication, physical therapy, biofeedback, or minimally invasive procedures such as trigger point injections or peripheral nerve blocks.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.Research raises questions about the connection between uterus removal and mental health.A new study found that taking hormonal contraceptives may have a small protective effect on severe cases of asthma in reproductive-age women.Lack of maternity care providers and no guaranteed maternity leave were cited as potential causes.When it comes to uterine fibroids, for women of color, taking control of your health is one of the most important steps to getting proper care.Heavy periods are one of the hallmark signs of uterine fibroids, but determining the cause of your heavy menstrual bleeding and finding the right treatment...By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy."
Essentials of an Endometriosis Diet,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/essentials-of-endometriosis-diet.aspx,"Can certain foods help lessen the pain and other discomforts that women with endometriosis feel? Learn the latest thinking on this topic, and what healthy eating with endometriosis looks like.There’s little agreement among doctors about whether food choices can help control the symptoms of endometriosis, a condition in which tissue similar to, but not the same as, uterine lining grows outside the uterus.A major review of 11 studies published in April 2013 in the journal Reproductive Biomedicine Online found the link between diet and endometriosis to be unclear. More research about this connection is needed, the authors say.A study published in 2017 in the journal Ginekologia Polska points to no clear association, either, although the researchers do find evidence that endometriosis is less likely to develop in the first place in women who eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, fish oils, dairy products, and omega-3 fatty acids. Meanwhile, women who eat foods high in fat, trans-unsaturated fatty acids, alcohol, and beef (along with other red meats) seem to be at increased risk for getting endometriosis.Supporters of a special endometriosis diet can be found, too. Among the most vocal is British nutritionist and author Dian Shepperson Mills, MA, director of the Endometriosis and Fertility Clinic in the United Kingdom and chair of the Endometriosis SHE Trust. Mills has spoken and written about food choices and endometriosis for years, and details her special endometriosis diet in her 2002 book co-authored with Michael Vernon, PhD, and called Endometriosis: A Key to Healing and Fertility through Nutrition.Thousands of women have tried the diet, she says, which is designed to reduce inflammation and quiet down the immune system’s angry reaction to endometrial tissue that’s not in its normal place inside the uterus. She says the diet also improves the response to pain, and helps in removing extra estrogen (the female sex hormone) responsible for worsening symptoms. Not only pain but fertility improves, she says.The nonprofit information hub Healthy Women also supports the thinking that diet and endometriosis symptoms are linked. The site cautions women with endometriosis to stay away from high-fat foods, since they may increase the level of circulating estrogen in the body. The more fat in your diet, the more estrogen your body produces. This also happens if you're overweight, they say.“Women with endometriosis should avoid fatty foods, such as red meat and [high-fat] dairy foods that may be high in PCBs and dioxins, to reduce their exposure to these estrogenic pesticides,” adds Shepperson Mills. Use organic food whenever you can, or peel fruits and vegetables, she recommends. Some research suggests a link between dioxins in the environment and increased levels of estrogen.A review published in 2017 in the journal Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity is one of several sources that describes a link between oxidative stress — which includes the formation of cell-damaging substances called free radicals — and endometriosis. Additional research found that a lack of antioxidants may contribute to endometriosis, while absorbing key antioxidant nutrients like selenium and vitamins A, C, and E may help keep it under control.You may also want to avoid citrus fruits, like grapefruit and oranges, as they can irritate your stomach and upset the way in which estrogen is excreted by the body. When excluding foods from your diet, just make sure to eat alternatives so you avoid any nutrient deficiencies.The core of Shepperson Mills’ diet for endometriosis includes these hallmarks of healthy nutrition:Your daily diet should provide 75 grams of good quality protein from sources like fish, eggs, and low-fat dairy products. Also include a handful of nuts, seeds, and legumes (such as beans), two portions of red or orange vegetables, two green leafy vegetables, and two fruits, including berries, which are high in antioxidants.Certain foods rich in key nutrients are important components in a diet for endometriosis:“Eating a wheat-free diet seems to help many women with endometriosis symptoms,” says Shepperson Mills. “Whether this is a result of gluten or another component of wheat is unclear, but it may be worth excluding wheat for one month to see if it makes a difference to your abdominal pains at periods and ovulation. You could also try to exclude dairy foods if you have excess mucus problems.”Support for going gluten-free with endometriosis can also be found in a study published in 2012 in the journal Minerva Chirurgica. The findings were promising in this research, which looked back at the experience of 207 women with severe, chronic endometriosis symptoms who removed gluten from their diet for 12 months. Painful endometriosis symptoms lessened for a significant number of the women, and while some reported no change in how they felt, at a minimum none indicated their pain got any worse.  “If a particular food is upsetting digestion and causing an immune system response, then that food should be avoided,” says Shepperson Mills.Some doctors aren’t sure that the diet is beneficial in terms of endometriosis relief per se. “Endometriosis is a funny entity in the sense of immunology,"" says John C. Petrozza, MD,  an obstetrician-gynecologist  and chief of reproductive medicine and IVF at Massachusetts General Hospital Fertility Center in Boston. Patients with endometriosis tend to have ""problems with asthma and allergies — it’s not uncommon to have irritable bowel syndrome, lactose intolerance, or gluten intolerance,"" he says. ""So is the diet really helping the endometriosis or the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome?”The bottom line: If you have endometriosis, talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian to see if changes to your diet might be worth trying.Additional reporting by Andrea PeirceBy subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.An expert answers frequently asked questions from women with endo&nbsp;Through advocacy and sharing vulnerable images of her ‘endo belly,’ Aronow wants other women to feel less alone.Facing the disease as a couple helped Kari and Ryan Anderson persevere and start a family.An open, honest, and raw conversation about what life with endo is really likeLiving with a medical mystery is not nearly as entertaining as watching other patients stump doctors on TV.

Making Pregnancy Possible With Endometriosis,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/making-pregnancy-possible-with-endometriosis.aspx,"There are lots of myths and misconceptions about endometriosis and pregnancy. Here’s the straight 411.Many women with endometriosis worry about whether they’ll be able to have children. While they do have reason to be concerned, the situation may not be as problematic as they fear.With endometriosis, or endo, tissue that’s similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus on other organs in the pelvis, such as the ovaries, fallopian tubes, bladder, and sometimes the bowels. That’s why endometriosis can cause widespread pelvic pain, severe menstrual cramps, and painful intercourse. Sometimes it also can interfere with a woman’s ability to get pregnant — but not always.Here are seven important facts about endometriosis and pregnancy:1. Fact: It often takes longer for women with endometriosis to become pregnant.The reasons for this aren’t completely understood. But there are several theories, including that pelvic adhesions (scar tissue) from endometriosis may inhibit the movement of eggs down the fallopian tubes; that the eggs themselves are of lesser quality; or that inflammation in the pelvis (caused by endometriosis) might stimulate the production of cells that attack the sperm and shorten their lifespan, according to Endometriosis.org, a nonprofit that promotes information-sharing among women with endometriosis, physicians, and scientists who are interested in the disease.2. Fact: Problems with fertility are often related to the severity of endometriosis.Simply put, the more severe the endometriosis is, the greater the odds are that a woman will have difficulty becoming pregnant. “Infertility is a high risk in terms of even conceiving — a lot of women require some type of assisted reproductive technology,” says Jacqueline Rohl, MD, an associate professor of ob-gyn at The Ohio State University Medical Center in Columbus. Indeed, medical treatment or surgery to remove or reduce endometriosis growths outside the uterus, or assisted reproductive technology (ART), can often improve a woman’s chances of becoming pregnant.But again, the stage of the disease can make a difference: A study published in July 2017 in the Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics found that women with stage 4 endometriosis have a significantly lower live birth rate after in vitro fertilization (IVF).There are several different classification systems for endometriosis. The one from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine is widely used: It includes four stages of endometriosis, based on the location, extent, and depth of the endometriosis implants, the presence and severity of adhesions (scar tissue), and the presence and severity of endometriomas (blood-filled cysts in the ovaries). While stage 1 involves few superficial implants and mild adhesions, stage 4 is characterized by deep endometriosis implants, large endometriomas, and many dense adhesions.The evidence on this subject is mixed, but some studies have found an increased risk of miscarriage among women with endometriosis.3. Fact: The risk of miscarriage could be slightly higher if you have endometriosis.The evidence on this subject is mixed, but some studies have found an increased risk of miscarriage among women with endometriosis. A study in the September 2019 issue of the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology found that endometriosis was associated with a 40 percent increased risk of miscarriage. And a study in the June 2017 issue of the European Journal of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Biology found that women with endometriosis who undergo IVF or intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) have double the rate of miscarriage. Whether this is due to endometriosis-caused inflammation in the uterus or dysfunctional uterine contractions or another factor isn’t clear.Even so, “I would counsel patients with endometriosis that in general they should not be overly concerned about miscarriage unless they have additional risk factors, like advanced maternal age or prior miscarriage,” says J. Daniel Woodall, DO, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Spectrum Health Pennock in Hastings, Michigan. “The overwhelming majority of women with endometriosis go on to deliver healthy babies without poor pregnancy outcomes.”More research is needed, but research suggests a link between endo and ectopic pregnancy.4. Fact: Women with endometriosis could have an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy.A meta-analysis of 15 studies in the February 2020 issue of the Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology concluded that women with endometriosis have a 2.66 higher risk of having an ectopic pregnancy — a pregnancy that occurs outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube — compared with women who don’t have the disease. The previously mentioned study in the September 2019 issue of Obstetrics and Gynecology found that endometriosis was associated with a 46 percent increased risk of ectopic pregnancy.This elevated risk may be because endometriosis can affect the fallopian tubes. “We know that fallopian tube damage definitely increases the risk of ectopic pregnancy, so it’s biologically reasonable to assume that if endometriosis is present involving the tube, ectopic pregnancy may be a higher risk,” Dr. Woodall says.Sometimes, but getting pregnant isn’t the same as getting treatment for endo.5. Fact: Endometriosis symptoms often improve during pregnancy.The condition really could get better during pregnancy, thanks to hormone changes. “In general, most women have a quiet state in terms of their disease [during pregnancy] because of the progesterone-dominant environment and the lack of menstrual cycles,” Dr. Rohl explains. In particular, research published in February 2108 in Human Reproduction Update has found that many endometriosis lesions regress or even disappear completely during pregnancy; however, some lesions remain stable, and some women experience a growth of these lesions during pregnancy. In other words, the way endometriosis behaves during pregnancy can vary considerably from one woman to another.If an unlucky woman does have endometriosis-related pain during pregnancy, she can take acetaminophen (Tylenol) but not ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin), Rohl says. Breathing exercises, yoga, acupuncture, and massage can also help.6. Fact: Breastfeeding also may offer a temporary reprieve from endometriosis symptoms.This is also due to hormonal changes, particularly the fact that breastfeeding inhibits the release of estrogen, thus thwarting ovulation and the growth of endometrial lesions. As a result, pain and discomfort from endometriosis are often milder while women are breastfeeding.But this improvement doesn’t last forever. Once a woman resumes her menstrual cycle and starts to ovulate again, her symptoms may return. “Everybody’s different — the disease is very variable from one woman to another in terms of how symptoms resume in intensity,” Rohl says.7. Fact: Pregnancy won’t cure endometriosis.Despite the pregnancy-related lull in endometriosis symptoms and progression, symptoms do tend to return after a woman’s menstrual cycles resume or breastfeeding is stopped. Still, some women find an improvement in their symptoms after having a baby. Which is why Rohl recommends that women try to be patient and see what happens rather than rushing back to the preventive medication protocol they were on. “It’s a disease that can wax and wane,” she says. But there is no cure.Interestingly, one past study, involving 345 women who were diagnosed with stage 2 to 4 endometriosis, found that the rate of recurrence was significantly lower in women who gave birth vaginally, compared with those who had a cesarean section. The theory is that during a vaginal delivery, the cervix opens much more, which later facilitates easier menstrual flow and decreases the risk of endometrial fragments making their way into the pelvic cavity where they don’t belong.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.An expert answers frequently asked questions from women with endo&nbsp;Through advocacy and sharing vulnerable images of her ‘endo belly,’ Aronow wants other women to feel less alone.Facing the disease as a couple helped Kari and Ryan Anderson persevere and start a family.An open, honest, and raw conversation about what life with endo is really likeLiving with a medical mystery is not nearly as entertaining as watching other patients stump doctors on TV.

Free Yourself From Fibroid Pain,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/free-yourself-from-fibroid-pain.aspx,"Uterine fibroids can lead to painful periods and a heavier flow — but there are ways to ease these symptoms.For most women, a certain degree of menstrual pain is relatively common. In fact, as many as 80 percent of women experience period pain. However, it can also be a sign of something more serious, like uterine fibroids.If you’re experiencing long-lasting period pain, or pain that worsens as you get older, it may be a sign of uterine fibroids.“Uterine fibroids are benign, smooth muscle growths of the uterus,” says Linda Bradley, MD, director of the Fibroid and Menstrual Disorders Center at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. These growths are rarely cancerous, and they’re very common — as many as 80 percent of women develop fibroids by age 50, according to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.That said, they’re more common in some populations than others. Although fibroids can develop at any age, uterine fibroids are most common in women ages 30 to 40. Black women are more likely to develop uterine fibroids than white women; fibroids tend to develop at a younger age and grow more quickly in Black women, as well.Some women who have uterine fibroids may not experience any symptoms. Others, however, may experience a range of symptoms that affect their period and beyond, such as:“Your symptoms generally depend on the location and number of uterine fibroids,” says Dr. Bradley.Each month, your uterus goes through a cycle: It creates a thickened inner lining in case a pregnancy occurs. If pregnancy does not occur, your body sheds that lining — this is your period.During a normal period, your body releases hormones called prostaglandins. These hormones can cause pain and inflammation and can increase the intensity of uterine contractions, which may worsen menstrual cramping. And women who have elevated levels of prostaglandins may experience even more severe menstrual pain.Fibroids can make this pain more intense: First, fibroids put pressure on the uterine lining. Then, if you have fibroids within the uterine wall, or fibroids that protrude into the uterine cavity, more surface area is created, which means more thickened lining for your body to shed during your period — that is, a heavier flow.“For women who bleed a lot, large clots can form,” says Bradley. “As all of this blood and clotting is trying to come through the narrow cervix and be expelled from the body, the uterus is contracting more, which can cause pain.”In the days leading up to your period, you might feel more intense cramping as your uterus goes through its motions to force out the lining, and a stronger sensation of pressure when your period starts because of the heavier blood flow.If the uterine fibroids are large, you also may feel a stronger sensation of pressure at the time of your period due to blood flow to the fibroids.Aside from uterine fibroids, period pain can be caused by other health conditions like endometriosis or ovarian cysts. So if you’re dealing with period pain, it’s important to see your doctor or gynecologist to determine the underlying cause and recommend the proper course of treatment, says Bradley.If you are diagnosed with uterine fibroids, a variety of treatment options can help you manage symptoms like heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, and pressure, and certain medications also treat the underlying uterine fibroids.“If it’s getting to the point where your quality of life is bad — you’re staying home and missing work, activities, and hobbies — your physician needs to look at other therapies, such as surgical procedures,” says Bradley.In the past, a hysterectomy, which removes the entire uterus, was the hallmark procedure for treating uterine fibroids. However, today there are a wide range of surgical options that are significantly less invasive and have a shorter recovery time.  These procedures, like radiofrequency ablation or embolization, aim to shrink or remove the uterine fibroids.“The number one cause of hysterectomies in America are due to uterine fibroids with pain, heavy bleeding, or discomfort,” says Bradley. “But it’s 2020, and we have new options — you’re not relegated to a hysterectomy. There are many other procedures that are less aggressive or less invasive.”Treatment is an individualized decision, and you need to see a physician who really looks at the whole patient, explains Bradley. The type of treatment you opt for should take into consideration your age, fertility plans, and the size and location of the uterine fibroids — and should be as minimally invasive as possible, she adds.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy."
Fibroid Pain: Beyond the Uterus,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/fibroid-pain-effects.aspx,"Do you wake up at night to use the bathroom, or feel full faster than you used to? Fibroids can affect the rectum, bladder, stomach, and kidneys too.Uterine fibroids, the most common pelvic growth among women, have different effects for each woman who has them.“Fibroids are like fingerprints — no two are ever alike,” says Steven Goldstein, MD, board-certified ob-gyn at New York University Langone Medical Center in New York. What determines how much pain and discomfort they cause is not necessarily size, but where they’re growing. “It’s like real estate — location, location, location,” says Dr. Goldstein.Fibroids are made of the muscle tissue found in the uterus, but their location isn’t limited to inside the uterine cavity. They can also grow on the outside of the uterus, and within the uterine walls, and can even attach themselves to the uterus by a stem of sorts.And especially for woman whose fibroids are growing outside of the uterus, other organs can be affected, too.Apart from pelvic symptoms like pain, heavy bleeding, and possibly infertility, fibroids can also cause problems with bladder and bowel elimination. This happens when fibroids affect the urinary and G.I. systems, leading to a variety of side effects.The Effects of Fibroids on Other OrgansFibroids can have a chain reaction effect that includes:Treating Fibroids When Other Organs Are AffectedStill, despite the potential effects of fibroids, some women do nothing to treat them. “The fibroids typically will grow at a certain rate per year, and a lot of women just grow into their symptoms and minimize them,” says Petrozza. “However, if you’re 40, for example, you may have another 11 to 12 years before menopause, when they [fibroids] typically stop growing.” That’s a long time to put up with the discomfort you’re experiencing.Talk to your doctor about how best to manage your fibroids. There are a variety of fibroids treatments that may help, from medication to surgical techniques, some designed to preserve fertility if you want to have children. But keep in mind, as Petrozza cautions, that the longer you wait and the bigger they get, the fewer fibroid treatment options you'll have.Learn more in the Everyday Health Women's Health Center.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.A new study found that taking hormonal contraceptives may have a small protective effect on severe cases of asthma in reproductive-age women.Lack of maternity care providers and no guaranteed maternity leave were cited as potential causes.How women value sex as they age, and why low-libido treatments are not available, were among the themes explored at the annual menopause meeting.The Supreme Court ruled that employers can refuse to offer birth control coverage as mandated by the Affordable Care Act if they have religious or moral...Count the Kicks, a prevention program, may spare some families from late pregnancy loss.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy."
Why Sex Hurts With Endometriosis,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/why-sex-hurts-with-endometriosis.aspx,"Many women with endometriosis experience pain during intercourse. If this happens to you, consider these strategies to lessen or even stop what’s hurting during and after penetration.Many women with endometriosis say that intercourse hurts. In fact, about two-thirds of women with endometriosis have sexual dysfunction of some type, according to an analysis published in 2017 in Reproductive Sciences.Pain with intercourse, or dyspareunia, is different for every woman. Some women say the pain is mild while others describe it as sharp and stabbing. Some report a deep, widespread aching. Many say there’s pain with penetration of any kind, while others say it only hurts with very deep penetration.And while some women say it only hurts during actual intercourse, others describe pain that lasts for hours after sex — sometimes even up to two days.For most women, it’s the location rather than the size of the endometriosis lesions that determines the amount of pain that’s felt, according to endometriosis.org. If the misplaced endometrial tissue is behind the vagina and the lower part of the uterus, and affecting uterine nerves or ligaments, intercourse is likely to be more painful because thrusting during sex pushes and pulls at the growths. And sometimes women feel pain with intercourse because the vagina is dry from hormone treatment or a hysterectomy.Anxiety about sex being painful can also make things difficult. “When there’s pain during intercourse, over a period of time, tension plays a big role,” explains John C. Petrozza, MD, an obstetrician-gynecologist and chief of reproductive medicine and in vitro fertilization at Massachusetts General Hospital Fertility Center in Boston.“A woman then anticipates pain, which creates a difficult emotional state,” says Dr. Petrozza. “You’re anxious to please your partner, but fearful of post-coital pain. The tendency is to tense up, and sex becomes more painful even with [minimal] penetration,” he says.The first step:Talk to your gynecologist and your other doctors. If you feel embarrassed about discussing this topic, remember that your sexual function is part of your overall health as a human being. Sexual functioning and response is complex, and involves not just your physical but your psychological and relationship health. The authors from the analysis published in Reproductive Sciences say that ideally, women who experience pain during sex should get input and advice from a team of people that includes gynecologists, psychologists, and even sexologists.If you have endometriosis and sex hurts, you can also try these strategies:If these strategies aren’t enough to make things better, talk to your doctor about medical treatments for endometriosis, such as taking birth control pills or other hormone therapies to lessen the size of the endometriosis lesions.And if you haven’t been diagnosed with endometriosis but experience pain during intercourse, talk to your doctor. This pain is often an early sign of the disease, and things will turn out better if you get a diagnosis and treatment sooner rather than later.Additional reporting by Andrea PeirceBy subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.An expert answers frequently asked questions from women with endo&nbsp;Through advocacy and sharing vulnerable images of her ‘endo belly,’ Aronow wants other women to feel less alone.Facing the disease as a couple helped Kari and Ryan Anderson persevere and start a family.An open, honest, and raw conversation about what life with endo is really likeLiving with a medical mystery is not nearly as entertaining as watching other patients stump doctors on TV.

How In Vitro Fertilization Can Help You Conceive,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/how-in-vitro-fertilization-can-help-you-conceive.aspx,"IVF has helped countless infertile couples experience the joys of parenthood. Weigh the pros and cons, and see if you're a good candidate for this fertility treatment.Every year, in vitro fertilization (IVF) helps thousands of American couples realize their dreams of becoming parents. But the chances of having a child through IVF depend on a variety of factors, and the treatment can be both costly and time-consuming, so not every couple is a good candidate.IVF is a form of reproduction in which eggs are surgically removed from a woman’s ovaries and then joined with a man’s sperm in an IVF clinic laboratory. Both eggs and sperm can be the couple’s own or from donors. If fertilization is successful, doctors then transfer the embryo or embryos into the woman’s womb. Hopefully, at least one of the embryos implants successfully, and she carries the pregnancy to term. Additional embryos that are not transferred can be frozen in the lab for future use.In most cases, fertility drugs are prescribed beforehand to stimulate the ovaries to produce and ripen more eggs. Recent research from Britain suggests that doctors should aim to retrieve about 15 eggs per IVF cycle for the best chance of achieving a live birth. Fewer than 15 lowers the success rate, but more than 20 risks over-stimulating the ovaries, a complication known as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). In mild or moderate cases of OHSS, women may have abdominal pain, swelling, nausea, and vomiting. Severe cases can lead to life-threatening kidney failure or blood clots, but these are rare.Are You a Good Candidate for In Vitro Fertilization?Approximately one in eight American couples has fertility problems. If you are a woman under 35 and have been having unprotected sex for a year and haven’t conceived, or you are over 35 and haven't conceived after six months, it’s probably time to see your doctor.IVF is an infertility treatment of last resort, tried when other less-expensive techniques haven’t worked. Generally, women under age 35 have a better chance of having a baby using in vitro fertilization. But to really determine who might benefit, doctors need to investigate the cause of the infertility. Today, IVF is used to address a variety of causes, including:IVF is not successful for everyone. For example, women with fibroid tumors, uterine abnormalities, abnormal hormone levels, and ovarian dysfunction may have lower success rates.In Vitro Fertilization Success RatesStatistics vary from one IVF clinic to another and should be interpreted with care. Some clinics report pregnancy rates, but not all pregnancies continue to full term, so it’s important to look at an IVF clinic’s live birth rate. After all, you don’t want to just get pregnant — you want to have a baby.According to the Society of Assisted Reproductive Technologies (SART), the approximate chances of giving birth to a live baby via IVF are:As the statistics show, the chance of conceiving and eventually giving birth drops considerably for women in their late thirties and into their forties. In older women, using donor eggs can increase success rates, but it’s also important to remember that the chance of miscarriage rises with age.Deciding Whether IVF Is Right for YouIf you and your doctors believe you are a good candidate for in vitro fertilization, there are certain other factors you need to consider:Despite all the possible pitfalls, thousands of couples build their families through IVF.

Infertility Etiquette: What Not to Say to Someone Trying to Conceive,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/infertility-etiquette-what-not-to-say-to-someone-trying-to-conceive.aspx,"Saying nothing or the wrong thing can hurt a woman going through the already emotional upheaval of infertility. This crash course in infertility etiquette can help you lend a sympathetic (and sensitive) shoulder.For some women, getting pregnant is enjoyable and almost effortless. But for others, the road to conception can be difficult — sometimes impossible. In fact, more than 7 million women in the United States are either unable to get pregnant at all or unable to carry a baby to term, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These women face infertility struggles that can completely take over their lives, both physically and emotionally. Someone in your world — a co-worker, a friend, a relative — may be dealing with infertility right now, and the tactfulness and sensitivity you show in your interactions could make or break your relationship.Knowing what to say or not say to someone coping with fertility struggles can be difficult, especially since she may not give you any clues. Plus, what’s comforting to one person might be hurtful to someone else. There’s no hard rule on infertility etiquette, but these tips, from both experts and real women struggling to get pregnant, may help.Nobody knows the pain of infertility better than women who are going through it themselves. Take, for example, Amy Miller (not her real name), a public relations professional in San Francisco. Miller has experienced the impact of four rounds of unsuccessful infertility treatments — the first resulted in the loss of twins at 20 weeks, the second failed to take, the third resulted in a blighted ovum, and the fourth also failed to take — all while “dozens of our friends, family, and other people around us popped out babies like it was the easiest thing in the world,” she says.Miller’s first piece of advice for people who know someone facing infertility is just to say something. “Even if you don’t know what to say, simply saying ‘I’m sorry’ is better than saying nothing at all,” she says. “People wanted to give us our space, but that just made us feel more isolated.”Sarah Smith (not her real name), an entrepreneur in New York City who has been dealing with infertility for a year and a half, agrees. “I just want a little empathy — a ‘That sucks’ or even ‘At least you can still have a beer,’” she says. “I would rather they try to relate than not say anything.”Mary Hinckley, MD, a reproductive endocrinologist at the Reproductive Science Center in the San Francisco Bay area, also stresses the importance of acknowledging a situation as life-altering as infertility. “At some point, the fertile friend should address the issue in private by telling her friend struggling with infertility that she cannot begin to understand how hard it is but that she is available to talk about the situation,” Hinckley says.Beyond lending an ear, Dr. Hinckley also recommends spending quality time with your friend. “Get a baby-sitter for your kids, and go out to a movie or to dinner or join a jogging club or yoga class together,” she suggests. “Psychological studies show that distraction can sometimes be the best strategy for infertility sadness in the short term.”Equally important is knowing what not to say to a friend facing an infertility struggle. Prevent foot-in-mouth disease by steering clear of these dialogue disasters:Have you tried _____?  “I hate when people start asking me: ‘Have you had this test? Have you tried acupuncture? Have you had your husband’s sperm tested?’” says Smith. “Yes, we’ve had the tests, and, yes, we are exploring our options. I would rather not discuss the details of infertility treatments unless you have real expertise on the subject. It’s so annoying and, frankly, insensitive.”Hinckley says offering advice may make the recipient feel like the advice giver doesn’t think she is smart or motivated enough to seek help. “However, if the friend facing infertility is feeling lost or depressed or doesn’t know what to do or what is normal, asking open-ended questions and listening may be the best thing you can offer,” she says.I’m pregnant! Yay!  “If you become pregnant yourself, be careful about how you tell a person who’s dealing with infertility,” Miller says. “We had some friends who denied a pregnancy when we noticed a baby’s room during a visit to their home and then called us all chipper a few days later to break the news, which was hurtful. Another friend called my husband and calmly said, ‘We wanted to tell you we are expecting, and we hope it’s not awkward for you,’ which was a much more sensitive way to handle it.”Here — hold the baby!  “If a friend undergoing infertility treatment is strong enough to visit you after you’ve given birth, don’t shove the baby in her arms,” Miller says. “Instead, ask if she wants to hold the baby, and be understanding of the fact that her reaction might be different from that of someone who is not dealing with infertility.”It will all work out.  You might think this would be comforting, but it can actually be quite hurtful. “When I tell people I can’t get pregnant, a lot of people say, ‘It will happen,’ or ‘You’re so young.’ I’m almost 36, so I don’t feel so young,” Smith says.Hinckley says that ""dismissive statements such as these can minimize the pain and sadness of someone who is going through infertility treatment."" Also not sensitive is ""suggesting they ‘go on vacation and just have sex every day.'""It’s better if you just move on.  “You should never tell someone facing infertility that they should just get over it,” Miller says. “They will get that feedback from support groups filled with people going through the same infertility struggles.”Overall, when it comes to infertility etiquette, it’s best to step into the shoes of your friend and try to understand how you would feel if you were faced with certain comments, says Fran Praver, PhD, a clinical psychologist in Locust Valley, N.Y., and author of The New Science of Love: How Understanding Your Brain's Wiring Can Help Rekindle Your Relationship. “Would you want to hear a friend complain about a past pregnancy, push adoption, or tell you to relax?” she asks. Think about what would make you feel hurt versus what would make you feel understood and supported if you were the one facing infertility, she suggests. Such empathy is key to maintaining the relationship.On a positive note, Miller says that if any good has come from her infertility struggle, it’s that it has taught her and her husband to express more of the empathy they crave from others. “We are able to more sensitively talk to people dealing with death and other losses in their lives,” she says. “So, in that way, infertility has made us better people.”By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.A new study found that taking hormonal contraceptives may have a small protective effect on severe cases of asthma in reproductive-age women.Lack of maternity care providers and no guaranteed maternity leave were cited as potential causes.How women value sex as they age, and why low-libido treatments are not available, were among the themes explored at the annual menopause meeting.The Supreme Court ruled that employers can refuse to offer birth control coverage as mandated by the Affordable Care Act if they have religious or moral...Count the Kicks, a prevention program, may spare some families from late pregnancy loss.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy."
January Jones Eats Her Placenta â?? Should You?,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/0330/january-jones-eats-her-placenta-should-you.aspx,"The 'Mad Men' actress recently revealed that taking placenta pills has helped her bounce back from giving birth. Find out what all the fuss is about.FRIDAY, March 30, 2012 — Let’s get one thing straight: January Jones is not Betty Draper Francis, the character she plays on AMC’s drama Mad Men.For one thing, Betty is a bored housewife whose maid knows her kids better than she does; Jones is a working actress raising a 6-month-old son by herself. And while Betty rarely ever ingests anything except cigarette smoke and vodka, Jones sticks to a healthy diet of actual food (Betty would never!), tea, and nutritional supplements — including some made from her own placenta.Yes, you read that right.Jones recently revealed to People that after giving birth to her son, Xander, she had her placenta dehydrated, ground up, and then encapsulated in pill form by a doula. “It’s something I was very hesitant about, but we’re the only mammals who don’t ingest our own placentas,” she explained to the magazine, adding that she credits the pills with helping her bounce back and get back to work after her pregnancy. “It’s not witch-crafty or anything! I suggest it to all moms!”In fact, placenta supplements are part of a growing trend of placentophagia, or placenta consumption. Last summer, New York Magazine even published a piece about it called “The Placenta Cookbook,” which detailed the history and practice of eating afterbirth, both in pill form and in placenta-based recipes. (One woman claimed she used a blender, a banana, and some coconut water to make a placenta smoothie; another couple toasted their new family with pieces of placenta jerky.)So what’s the deal? Is afterbirth some kind of new culinary adventure? Not quite. According to the article, placenta supplements “are said to alleviate postpartum depression, aid in breastmilk production and lactation, act as a uterine tonic, and replenish nutrients lost during pregnancy.”“There is certainly a potential medicinal use,” ABC News quoted David Katz, MD, founder of the Yale Prevention Center, as saying last year. “This is a time-honored cultural practice of eating the placenta. It is nutrient-rich and a source of hormones.”Indeed, placenta has long been recognized in other societies for its potential healing powers and spiritual significance. In traditional Chinese medicine, for example, dried placenta is mixed with herbs and then ingested to treat infertility and lactation issues, among other things. And in Indonesia, Morocco, and the Czech Republic, some new moms believe that placenta-eating guarantees future fertility.Unfortunately, there’s no sound science to support any of these claims, says Mark Kristal, PhD, a behavioral neuroscientist at the University of Buffalo who has been studying placentophagia for 40 years.“It’s a New Age phenomenon,” Kristal told New York Magazine. “Every ten or twenty years, people say, ‘We should do this because it’s natural and animals do it.’ But it’s not based on science. It’s a fad.”That’s not to say the health benefits of placenta couldn’t be real, however — just that they haven’t yet been proven. In fact, Kristal and colleagues just published a paper in the journal Ecology of Food and Nutrition calling for more research on the subject. They point out that placenta ingestion by non-human mammals seems to increase mother-infant interaction and even facilitate caretaking behavior, both of which could be medically relevant with regards to postpartum depression. As of now, though, no studies exist to prove these benefits in humans, and until they do, Kristal says, there’s no real scientific reason for new moms to ingest their own placentas — despite Jones’ ringing endorsement.""People will do anything,"" Kristal said in a press release about the paper, ""but we shouldn't read too much significance into reports of such exceptions, even if they are accurate, because they are neither reliable nor valid studies. My own studies found no evidence of the routine practice of placentophagia in other cultures.""The more challenging anthropological question is 'Why don't humans engage in placentophagia as a biological imperative as so many other mammals apparently do?'” he added. “Perhaps for humans, there is a greater adaptive advantage to not eating the placenta.""Did you eat your placenta, or would you?

Certain Birth Control Pills May Carry Higher Blood Clot Risk,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/0411/certain-birth-control-pills-may-carry-higher-blood-clot-risk.aspx,"All about pregnancy prevention with pills, patches, implants, and other types of birth control, plus information on effectiveness, potential side effects, and more.It’s a fact: As a woman, if you have sex with a man, it’s possible to get pregnant. But if you don’t want to get pregnant, there are many forms of birth control to help prevent pregnancy.Also called contraception, birth control has several different options. While abstinence, or refraining from intercourse, is the only way to prevent pregnancy with 100 percent certainty, there are both nonhormonal and hormonal methods of contraception.Nonhormonal methods generally create a physical barrier between the sperm and the egg. There are also two permanent methods requiring surgery: sterilization, or tubal ligation, for women, and vasectomy for men.Hormonal methods generally make it less likely that a woman will release an egg, that an embryo will form, or that an embryo will be implanted.“It varies, and it depends on you and your lifestyle,” says Keosha T. Bond, doctor of education, an assistant professor of epidemiology at New York Medical College in Valhalla, New York. “I try to explain there’s no 'one size fits all.' It’s more, ‘What can I do, and how does my body react?’ There are so many contraceptive methods out there, but every one won’t fit every person.”Learn More About The Best and Worst Birth Control OptionsIn addition to the many methods detailed in the list of contraception options, today women have access to emergency contraception (EC). Sometimes called next-day birth control or the morning-after pill, EC is a safe way to prevent pregnancy up to five days after unprotected sex.Learn More About Emergency ContraceptionBirth control methods are measured based on perfect use — meaning when they are used correctly every single time — and actual use, which is a more typical basis. For example, if birth control pills are supposed to be taken at the same time every single day, perfect use means the person is taking those pills exactly as directed. Typical use would mean that the pills were perhaps taken most of the time, but not every single day, or not at the same time every single day.Here’s a look at every kind of birth control available today:Contraception based on hormones help alter how your body works to get and stay pregnant. These range from daily use options, such as birth control pills, to long-term use approaches, such as hormone-based IUDs, which stay in place for several years, says Dr. Bond.There are many different kinds of birth control pills available, including high and low doses of hormones, some that change dosages based on a woman’s cycle, and others that give the same amount all month long, says Bond.Some important facts:Some people don’t do well on hormonal contraception, which typically includes either estrogen, a form of progesterone called progestin, or a combination of the two. “Each woman is different, and you have to understand your body,” says Bond. If you notice one or more of these side effects, let your doctor know:For some people, using hormones is not recommended. “The pill is easy and awesome, but if you have migraines with aura (vision changes during a bad headache), or have a history of deep vein thrombosis, stroke, or other cardiac changes,” talk to your doctor to learn if you should consider another birth control option, says Christine Carlan Greves, MD, an ob-gyn based in Orlando, Florida. “If you have a blood clotting disorder, or breast cancer, you don’t want to take progesterone,” she added. Smokers, and those considered overweight or obese, should talk to their doctors about which contraceptives are recommended for them.When the birth control pill was first introduced in 1960, it changed everything, especially for women.Reliable contraception was scarce a hundred years ago. For women, having sexual intercourse meant risking pregnancy. Prior to the arrival of the pill, withdrawal and abstinence were the main birth control methods available. And there were other risks and obstacles related to using birth control to space or prevent pregnancies. One big obstacle was the Comstock Act of 1873, which made birth control illegal.According to Planned Parenthood, fully one-third of the wage gains made by American women since the 1960s can be traced back to oral contraceptives. Between 1970 and 1990, hormonal birth control accounted for some 30 percent of the increase in the rate of women entering skilled careers like medicine and law. The birth control pill has also been the most influential factor enabling women to stay in college.Learn More About Birth Control in America: A Brief History of ContraceptionKnown by the above names, an injection of Depo-Provera can help prevent pregnancy for three months. It’s a shot of progestin, which works by keeping your ovaries from releasing eggs, as well as thickening the cervical mucous so sperm can’t travel effectively.This is a small rod about the size of a matchstick that is placed into the upper arm. It releases progestin, which prevents your body from releasing eggs, and makes it tougher for sperm to move. It’s good for up to four years of pregnancy protection.Like many birth control pills, the vaginal ring contains both progestin and estrogen. Unlike oral pills, a woman inserts the ring into her vagina (similar to inserting a tampon) and the hormones work to prevent ovulation and pregnancy. It is worn each month and needs to be changed on a specific schedule, typically after three weeks, with a week off for a period. Then a new ring is inserted for the next cycle.Resembling a small square Band-Aid, the beige contraceptive patch is worn on the skin and infuses estrogen and progestin so that ovulation doesn’t happen. It needs to be changed out every week and is available in generic form known as Xulane. (5)IUDs (short for intrauterine device) are one of the most effective forms of birth control — they're more than 99 percent effective against pregnancy. Once recommended only for women who've already had children, experts now say that women who haven’t had children can effectively use an IUD.IUDs are inserted into the uterus by a healthcare professional, and can work for 3 to 12 years, depending on which one you choose. They can also be removed any time if a woman wants to try to get pregnant.There are five kinds of IUDs available in the United States. Four of these work with a small amount of pregestin, which thickens cervical mucous and prevents sperm from reaching an egg. Known by the brand names Mirena, Kyleena, Liletta, and Skyla, these IUDs can be inserted for a period of three to six years. They can also make your period lighter or disappear altogether. Talk to your doctor about which one might be right for you.The fifth kind of IUD is made with plastic and a small amount of copper and is called the ParaGard. It prevents sperm from reaching an egg because sperm dislike copper. It does not affect your period and can be worn for up to 12 years.These are older methods of contraception that are still available, but aren’t as effective or as easy to use as other methods. “Sponges or a diaphragm? I don’t want to say they are outdated, but they aren’t talked about as much today by healthcare providers,” says Bond. All three methods need to be inserted into the vagina before having sex, so “they took away from the romance and the whole aspect of engaging in sex,” she says.Similarly, “a diaphragm doesn’t work that great,” says Greves. “It’s better than nothing, but I don’t remember the last time I recommended it for someone.”The Quick Diaphragm DetailsThe Quick Sponge DetailsThe Quick Cervical Cap DetailsThere are condoms available for men to use as a sheath over the penis as well as for women to use internally in the vagina or anus. Both are used to avoid pregnancy as well as to reduce the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) from person to person. While male condoms are made from latex, plastic, or lambskin, female condoms are made only from plastic, which helps people with a latex allergy.There are several variations of this kind of birth control, also known as the rhythm method or Natural Family Planning. Overall, they work when a woman notices her most fertile days of her menstrual cycle by the kind of cervical secretions in her vagina, as well as measuring basal body temperature (the body’s temperature upon waking) — these are collectively known as symptom-based methods. If a woman is trying to determine fertility based on the length of several menstrual cycles, it is called a calendar-based method. It is used for birth control when a woman actively avoids sex during her most fertile times of her menstrual cycle.Related: Some Fertility Tracker Apps Are Useful, Study SaysThis is only effective for women with two or more menstrual cycles that are between 26 and 32 days. (It doesn’t work when cycles are shorter or longer). Generally, the first fertile day is day 8 of a woman’s menstrual cycle, beginning with day 1 when the period first arrives. The last fertile day is day 19. Unprotected sex is avoided starting on day 8 and continuing through the end of day 19.This is when a woman checks her cervical secretions twice a day to determine her fertility. If there are no secretions, it is unlikely she is fertile and therefore is less likely to get pregnant, as sperm cannot move toward an egg easily and live up to five days in the vagina without such secretions. If she feels secretions, both on one day and the day after, she is likely in her most fertile period, and therefore more likely to get pregnant.Cervical mucus has different consistencies throughout the menstrual cycle. Learning the differences can help you understand what's happening in your ovaries and in your cycle. There are several ways to check cervical mucus, and it can be done first thing in the morning. Wipe the vagina before urinating, observe mucus on the underwear upon waking, or reach into the vaginal opening with clean fingers to see and feel the mucus.Recording the description of the mucus on a calendar or app will help you see patterns during the menstrual cycle. Menstrual blood may hide cervical mucus, so consider period days fertile ones. Once the period ends, there are typically dry days that may be considered less-fertile days depending on the length of your cycle. As an egg begins to get ready for ovulation, cervical mucus will appear, typically yellow, white, cloudy, and more or less sticky.Right before the egg is released (ovulation), mucus gets slippery so it can best help sperm move to meet an egg. This is the most fertile time and when it is best to avoid unprotected vaginal sex. After several days, cervical secretions get more cloudy and sticky, and then disappear. When there are no secretions, this time is considered infertile. This phase continues until the period begins again and the cycle starts over.Another method often used along with cervical mucus tracking involves taking your temperature upon first waking up in the morning. The body temperature rises slightly when you ovulate, so tracking the rates for at least three months can help predict when you are most fertile (and when to avoid unprotected vaginal sex).It is recommended to take your temperature at the same time in the morning every day, yet it is important to understand that sickness, stress, fatigue, and other factors can affect the body’s temperature. Consult a healthcare provider or counselor about tracking your observations and how to best interpret your chart for contraception purposes.You can call it the ultimate combo: Using two or three FAM approaches, such as cervical mucus observations, plus a calendar or basal body temperature charting to predict ovulation, the symptom-thermal fertility awareness method increases effectiveness and reduces failure rates compared with the use of one FAM method alone.Learn More About Natural Family Planning and Fertility Awareness-Based Methods of Birth Control.This method is when new mothers exclusively breastfeed their new babies for a period of up to about six months. Exclusive breastfeeding means the baby is nursed on demand (during the day and at night), does not use any bottles or pacifiers, is not eating any formula or other foods, and the mother hasn’t had her period return yet, not even spotting, since six weeks after delivery.LAM efficacy rates are about 98 to 99 percent if the mother follows all the above conditions, but start to decline as soon as an infant eats more than breastmilk, nurses less than on demand, or the mother’s period returns. In these cases, using a second form of contraception, such as a condom, is a good idea to prevent an unplanned pregnancy.Fertility awareness methods takes a lot of dedication, both in tracking changes over several months as well as avoiding vaginal sex (or using condoms) when most fertile.“I don’t think FAM is reliable,” says Bond. “There is pre-ejaculation that can contain sperm that you can become pregnant by. If you are not sure about having some kind of pill, or other hormonal contraception, you should consider using condoms, because they are easy and don’t require that much change in the body.”What makes one method more effective than another? Failure rates are one factor taken into account when public health experts look at reliability and viability.

It’s tricky, because pre-ejaculate can form before withdrawal. Avoiding pregnancy means keeping all sperm away from the vagina, and even a small amount of sperm can get into the vagina and lead to pregnancy. This method is best used when combined with condoms.Avoiding any kind of vaginal, anal, or oral sex is called abstinence, and activities such as kissing, dry-humping, masturbating, massage, and talking about fantasies are considered outercourse.

Is Combining Hysterectomy and a Tummy Tuck Safe?,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/0511/is-combining-hysterectomy-and-a-tummy-tuck-safe.aspx,"A hysterectomy is a surgical operation to remove the uterus, the hollow, pear-shaped muscular organ located in the female lower abdomen and pelvis. This organ, essential to reproduction, sits behind the bladder and in front of the rectum. (1)Attached to the uterus on each side is a single fallopian tube and one ovary.During pregnancy, a fertilized egg implants itself in the lining of the uterus where the developing fetus is nourished prior to birth. (2)After undergoing hysterectomy, a woman no longer has menstrual periods and she cannot become pregnant.Among American women, hysterectomy is a very common type of surgery. After cesarean section, it is the second most frequently performed surgical procedure for women who are of reproductive age in the United States. (3)Each year, approximately 600,000 hysterectomies are performed in the United States. (4)According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 20 million women in the United States have had a hysterectomy. (5) By age 60, more than one-third of all women in the United States have had a hysterectomy. (3)The majority of these procedures are performed as a treatment for health conditions when alternate therapies, such as medication, hormone treatments, or less invasive surgical procedures have been unsuccessful in completely alleviating symptoms such as bleeding and pain.In far fewer instances, a hysterectomy may be necessary to save a women’s life (for example, to stop life-threatening bleeding after the birth of a baby) or to help prevent the spread of certain gynecological cancers.There are essentially three types of hysterectomy, depending on which structures are removed:Sometimes a surgeon will perform additional surgeries at the time of hysterectomy.One or both of your ovaries may also be removed. This is called a salpingo-oophorectomy. An oophorectomy is the surgical removal of the ovaries.A salpingectomy is the removal of the fallopian tubes. The ovaries and tubes may be removed in certain situations — for example, when they are affected by endometriosis. (7)There are several approaches to hysterectomy. The uterus can be removed through an open incision in the lower abdomen, through the vagina, or with a laparoscopic technique in which the uterus is removed through a few small incisions made in the abdomen.Each option involves unique risks and benefits, and recovery time can vary depending on the method used. In some instances a women’s choice of procedure is limited — for example, if she has a very large uterus, a vaginal or laparoscopic procedure may not be an option.An abdominal hysterectomy offers the surgeon the most flexibility. It may be recommended over other types of hysterectomy if you have a large uterus, or you have lots of scar tissue from previous abdominal surgeries, are obese, or if there is a known cancer. Abdominal hysterectomy is the most common method used in the United States.An average surgery takes approximately one to two hours. (8)Both vaginal and laparoscopic techniques are considered minimally invasive because surgeons make smaller incisions and use smaller surgical instruments. (9)During a vaginal hysterectomy, the uterus is removed through the vagina. No abdominal incision is made. Vaginal hysterectomy generally causes fewer complications than either abdominal or laparoscopic surgery. Recovery time is also shorter for the most part. Whenever possible, it is the preferred method. You can expect to be in the operating room for about one to two hours. (8)Learn More About Types and Methods of HysterectomyWith this procedure, surgeons only need to make a few small (about ½ inch) incisions in the abdomen. Then a laparoscope — a fiber optic instrument — is inserted in one of these openings. The laparoscope allows the surgeon to see the pelvic organs. The uterus can be removed in small pieces through the incisions, through a larger incision made in the abdomen, or through the vagina (a procedure known as laparoscopic vaginal hysterectomy, or LAVH). This method results in less infection than the abdominal option. The procedure takes about two hours. (8)Most hysterectomies are elective, which means a woman should have time and opportunity to explore and discuss other options to manage pain and other symptoms.With the exception of certain gynecological cancers or a rare emergency, such as uncontrollable bleeding after childbirth, there are alternatives to hysterectomy that can treat every condition and symptom where surgical removal of the uterus is considered. Treatment options include medication, hormone treatments, and minimally invasive procedures.Learn More About Alternatives to HysterectomyUltimately, the root cause or origin of the problematic symptoms governs the solutions. For example, the growth of uterine fibroids, which are noncancerous tumors, may be slowed with medication. Pain from endometriosis may respond to Orilissa — the brand name for elagolix, a new medication — or other therapies.Learn More About Symptoms and Conditions That May Be Treated With HysterectomyHysterectomy can be used to treat several different conditions and problems, many of which have been considered “women problems.”Fibroids are benign (noncancerous) tumors that arise from the smooth muscle cells of the uterus. Some estimate that up to 80 percent of all women develop fibroids during their childbearing years. (10) Because they often cause no symptoms, doctors usually detect them incidentally during a pelvic exam or a prenatal ultrasound.Symptoms include heavy menstrual bleeding, prolonged menstrual periods (lasting more than a week), pelvic pain, frequent urination, low back pain, or painful intercourse.While symptoms often respond to medication or nonsurgical treatment, sometimes the symptoms are severe enough to warrant hysterectomy. Hysterectomy is the only permanent solution for uterine fibroids. (11)Endometrioisis is a disease in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows in other places in the body. This often painful condition affects about 10 percent of all women of childbearing age. (12) Most often endometriosis is found on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and the peritoneum (pelvic sidewall). It can also appear in the bowel and bladder. Rarely, it appears in other parts of the body such as the lungs.Symptoms include very painful menstrual cramps, chronic pain in the lower back and pelvis, intestinal pain, bleeding or spotting between periods, and digestive problems, including diarrhea, constipation, or nausea, especially when you are having your period. (13)Hormone therapy and pain medication may help alleviate pain. Minimally invasive procedures may be performed to remove disease, but often lesions return within a year or two. (14) Sometimes after repeated surgical treatments to remove the disease, or instances where hormonal therapy has failed to keep the disease at bay, women opt for a hysterectomy, though it's generally considered a last resort.Pregnancy, childbirth, and aging can weaken or stretch a woman’s pelvic supporting tissues and ligaments. In some cases, the uterus can lower or sag into the vagina. Women with this condition may experience pelvic pressure, urinary incontinence, or difficulty making a bowel movement.You can sometimes find relief from these symptoms through hysterectomy, along with repair.  (15)Heavy bleeding during your period is one example of abnormal uterine bleeding. Other instances include bleeding and spotting between periods, bleeding or spotting after sex, menstrual cycles that last longer than 38 days or shorter than 24 days, and bleeding after menopause. Benign growths in the uterus, either polyps or fibroids, are common causes. Medication is often the first line of treatment. If medication fails to reduce the bleeding, surgical procedures, like endometrial ablation or uterine artery embolization, are further options.Sometimes when all other treatments have failed, a woman may opt for a hysterectomy. (16)Chronic pelvic pain is pain in the pelvic area that last six months or longer. Most chronic pelvic pain can be attributed to endometriosis. Other conditions that can lead to chronic pelvic pain include fibroids, ovarian cysts, irritable bowel syndrome, and interstitial cystitis (painful bladder syndrome).Depending on the condition, treatment can include medication, physical therapy, biofeedback, or minimally invasive procedures, such as trigger point injections or peripheral nerve blocks. As a last resort, hysterectomy may be suggested for chronic pelvic pain that hasn’t responded to any other treatment. (17)Adenomyosis is a condition in which the tissue that lines the uterus grows inside the walls of the uterus where it doesn’t belong. The displaced tissue continues to act normally — thickening, breaking down, and bleeding — during each menstrual cycle. The condition sometimes results in an enlarged uterus and painful, heavy periods. The disease usually resolves after menopause. Doctors treat it in the same way as they do endometriosis. Sometimes hormonal treatments help.Hysterectomy is the definitive cure for adenomyosis. (8)About 10 percent of hysterectomies are performed to treat cancer. (19) Hysterectomy is the main treatment for endometrial cancer, which is the most common gynecologic cancer. Physicians consider the surgery the best option in many cases.Endometrial cancer is often detected at an early stage due to symptoms like abnormal vaginal bleeding, which might precipitate a doctor visit. Hysterectomy can often cure the cancer. (20)Unlike endometrial cancer, which is often caught in earlier stages, ovarian cancer, which begins in the ovaries, often goes undetected until it has spread within the pelvis and abdomen. Treatment for ovarian cancer usually involves a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. The surgery may involve hysterectomy, especially if the cancer is extensive. (21)Hysterectomy is also the most common treatment for early-stage cervical cancers, which begin in the cells lining the cervix, the lower part of the uterus.Only about 10 percent of the more than 600,000 hysterectomies performed in the United States each year are for cancer treatment and are considered potentially lifesaving. The rest of the hysterectomies performed are essentially elective procedures, and some experts believe that many of them are unnecessary.For example, problematic uterine fibroids may be addressed via alternative treatments, such as hormonal medication, uterine artery embolization, or myomectomy.Learn More About Hysterectomy: Do You Really Need It?Yes. With a less than 1 percent mortality rate, the procedure is considered to be a safe, low-risk surgery. (3)While hysterectomy is one of the safest surgical procedures, it is still surgery, so problems can occur.Risks associated with hysterectomy include: (22)Related: Hysterectomy Linked to Increased Risk for Depression, Other Mood Disorders, Says StudyWomen who enter menopause at a later age have slightly better recall than women going through this change earlier, a new British study has found.You may need to stay in the hospital for a day or two, sometimes a bit longer following abdominal hysterectomy. If a woman has a laparoscopic hysterectomy, she can often go home the same day.You can expect some pain for the first few days, but medication should help.You must avoid vaginal intercourse and any heavy (over 20 pounds) lifting for six weeks following surgery.Recovery time for an abdominal hysterectomy is approximately six weeks.Full recovery after vaginal hysterectomy may take three to four weeks.

Estrogen a Culprit in Inflammatory Bowel Disease,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/0521/estrogen-a-culprit-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease.aspx,"Positive relationship discovered between hormone replacement therapy, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease.SAN DIEGO — SUNDAY, May 20, 2012 (MedPage Today) — Postmenopausal women who take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are at increased risk for developing ulcerative colitis, whereas younger women using oral contraceptives are more likely to develop Crohn's disease, a researcher said here during a session on inflammatory bowel disease.Among current users of HRT, there was a 74 percent increase in risk of ulcerative colitis, compared with women who had never taken hormone replacements, according to Hamed Khalili, MD, of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, and colleagues.Estrogen is thought to have various effects on the intestinal barrier, modifying colonic permeability and mediating inflammation through effects on estrogen receptors, which could lead to changes in gut immunity.However, previous research has been limited to retrospective analyses and small numbers, so Khalili and colleagues examined rates of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in the Nurses' Health Study, which began enrolling women in 1976.For the postmenopausal HRT analysis, they included 108,589 women whose median age was 54 and who had no history of either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.During 1,891,153 person-years of follow-up, there were 138 new cases each of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.Risk of ulcerative colitis was increased not only among current users of HRT, but also among former users.The risk of ulcerative colitis was higher with longer use of HRT, but that risk dropped based on the length of time the woman had stopped HRT.The type of hormone therapy used did not appear to influence ulcerative colitis risk.Among these older women, there was no association between HRT and Crohn's disease, Khalili said.In the oral contraceptive analysis, Khalili and colleagues followed 232,730 women for a total of more than 5 million person-years.During that time, there were 309 cases of Crohn's disease and 362 cases of ulcerative colitis.For Crohn's disease, the risk remained elevated even among past users of oral contraceptives.In contrast to the HRT study, this analysis found no link between oral contraceptives and risk for ulcerative colitis.Together, these two analyses suggest that estrogen influences the biological pathways that lead to inflammatory bowel disease, Khalili said.As to why the effects would be different for estrogen levels associated with oral contraceptives compared with those with hormone replacement therapy, he observed that ""estrogen has pleiotropic effects,"" and there may be different risk factors at different ages, but said he had no specific mechanism to offer.One implication of the study was that clinicians might advise women who have a strong family history of Crohn's disease to use other forms of birth control to minimize their chance of developing the condition.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.A new study found that taking hormonal contraceptives may have a small protective effect on severe cases of asthma in reproductive-age women.Lack of maternity care providers and no guaranteed maternity leave were cited as potential causes.How women value sex as they age, and why low-libido treatments are not available, were among the themes explored at the annual menopause meeting.The Supreme Court ruled that employers can refuse to offer birth control coverage as mandated by the Affordable Care Act if they have religious or moral...Count the Kicks, a prevention program, may spare some families from late pregnancy loss.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy."

Yeast Infections A yeast infection is a type of vaginitis, and 3 out of 4 women will experience at least one in their life; half of women will have more than one. Yeast infections can be passed to men, but this is rare.What it is: Yeast infections are caused by a naturally occurring fungal organism called Candida albicans. The acidic environment of the vagina helps keep the yeast from growing, but when the pH  is altered, a yeast infection can occur. Moisture and other irritation can also promote the yeast to grow, causing vaginal itching.Certain medications, antibiotics, steroids and birth control pills, stress, pregnancy, diabetes, and AIDS can kill “good bacteria,” cause changes in hormones or weaken the immune system, which all contribute to yeast infections.

"8 Fertility Myths, Debunked",https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/fertility-myths-debunked.aspx,"Surveys show that many women are misinformed about fertility and conception. Do you know the facts behind these common rumors?Fertility can be a very confusing topic, and there’s a lot of misinformation about it. In fact, just 14 percent of women surveyed recently by the American Society of Reproductive Medicine knew the length of time it can take to achieve pregnancy, and less than 10 percent accurately guessed the likelihood of becoming pregnant across different age groups. To help clear a few things up, here are some commonly believed pregnancy myths that can negatively affect women’s health and the ability to conceive.Reality: While you might look younger than your mom did when she was your age, your eggs don’t reflect this youthful exuberance. Live birth rates in women sink from an already tepid 28.4 percent at age 40 to 0 percent by age 46, according to research done at a Boston infertility center that looked at 2,700 women undergoing in vitro fertilization.In fact, your fertility starts to decline in your late twenties. “Women go from approximately 2 million eggs to 0 between birth and menopause,” says Daniel Potter, MD, a reproductive endocrinologist at HRC Fertility in Southern California. “Women who want to postpone pregnancy beyond age 35 should consider having their ovarian reserve baselines tested to determine how much time they have left.” You can also freeze your embryos or eggs when you’re younger to preserve fertility later in life, he adds.Reality: “The mucolytics [chemicals that help loosen mucus and make a cough more productive] in cough syrup may also make cervical secretions more liquid and inviting to sperm,” says Charla Blacker, MD, a reproductive endocrinologist with the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit. “But you have to drink a lot of cough syrup to get the effect.”Taking more than the recommended dose of any medicine — or using it in a way other than what it was designed for — is never a good idea. “However, as an alternative to cough syrup,” Blacker says, “Mucinex, which is sold over the counter, can do the same thing with a pill twice daily.”Reality: Women who have gotten pregnant before are more fertile than the population at large, which accounts for this misconception. “Pregnancy itself is a test of the fertility system, so women with a prior pregnancy know that at least at that time everything was right,” Dr. Blacker explains. “However, some of my most frustrated patients are those who conceived easily the first time and are now having trouble. To treat secondary infertility, the same potential causes need to be evaluated as in those having trouble the first time.”Reality: Women facing infertility are often told to take a body temperature reading first thing every morning, looking for that small increase that may signal the best time to get pregnant each month. “Unfortunately, a temperature rise [which indicates ovulation has taken place] only gives you information after the fact,” Dr. Potter says. “Instead, I would recommend women aiming for pregnancy look at their average cycle length” — the number of days between day one of your period and the next day one of your period — “subtract 14 days, and have intercourse three days in a row, with the day calculated above being the second day.”Reality: “There have been few studies that have been able to demonstrate differences in conception rate based on sexual position,” Blacker says of this commonly held fertility belief. “However, it’s important that a woman not jump right up after intercourse. Lying quietly for a few minutes for the sperm to get to their destination can be helpful in achieving pregnancy.”Reality: Causes for infertility are split right down the middle. “Roughly 40 percent of infertility cases arise from female causes, such as ovulation problems, tubal disease, or endometriosis,"" Blacker says. ""Another 40 percent arise from male problems, such as low sperm count, poor sperm motility, or abnormally shaped sperm. And 20 percent of couples will have something go wrong on both the female and the male sides to prevent pregnancy.""Reality: “Studies have actually shown the highest pregnancy rates in couples having daily intercourse around the fertile time,” Blacker says. In fact, the worst thing a couple can do, particularly when you’re dealing with infertility, is to “save up” for that one day. “Not only do you have an excellent chance of missing the big day,” Blacker adds, “but older sperm are less motile and more likely to contain genetic abnormalities.”Reality: Among 2,000 women who stopped taking birth control pills to try to have a baby, just 21 percent became pregnant within one cycle of stopping, according to a respected European study on oral contraceptives. This rate is nearly the same as the natural pregnancy rate of 20 percent to 25 percent per menstrual cycle in women not using any birth control.“For normally ovulating women, there may actually be a delay in fertility for a few months after stopping the pill,” Blacker says. However, this shouldn’t stop couples who want to get pregnant from trying at this time.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.A new study found that taking hormonal contraceptives may have a small protective effect on severe cases of asthma in reproductive-age women.Lack of maternity care providers and no guaranteed maternity leave were cited as potential causes.How women value sex as they age, and why low-libido treatments are not available, were among the themes explored at the annual menopause meeting.The Supreme Court ruled that employers can refuse to offer birth control coverage as mandated by the Affordable Care Act if they have religious or moral...Count the Kicks, a prevention program, may spare some families from late pregnancy loss.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy."

Menstrual Cycles May Affect Women's Shopping Patterns,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/0731/menstrual-cycles-may-affect-womens-shopping-patterns.aspx,"Learn about the causes of irregular menstruation.Menstruation is the monthly bleeding associated with a woman's menstrual cycle.The menstrual cycle is the series of hormonal changes that a woman's body goes through in preparation for pregnancy.Each month, the lining of the uterus (or womb) thickens. Your body sheds this lining, along with blood, if no fertilized egg attaches to the wall of the uterus.The blood and tissue pass out of the body through the vagina.The menstrual period, or menstruation, typically lasts three to five days for most women.Every woman's menstrual cycle is slightly different. A normal menstrual cycle length can be anywhere from 21 to 35 days. The average length of a menstrual cycle is 28 days.Many women track their menstrual cycles. If you're trying to become pregnant, keeping a record of your period can help you figure out when you're ovulating and whether your period is late.Tracking periods can also help you spot any irregularities or changes to your menstrual cycle.The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommends marking each day of your period with an ""X"" on a calendar. Note any pain or changes in flow.There are a number of websites and apps that offer free period trackers or period calculators.Be aware, though, that many period-tracking apps have been found to be inaccurate, according to a June 2016 review in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology.Dysmenorrhea, or menstrual cramping, is pain associated with menstruation.Menstrual cramps are common. More than half of all women who menstruate report some pain for one to two days each month, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.Hormones called prostaglandins can cause normal menstrual cramping. Prostaglandins are produced by the lining of the uterus.Cramps usually occur right before menstruation starts and may last for a day or two. Pain typically decreases throughout the period as you shed the uterine lining.See your doctor if pain gets worse as menstruation continues, doesn't go away after the end of the period, or is so severe that it affects your daily living. These may be signs of a more serious medical problem.Certain menstrual cycle disorders can cause a woman's period to be irregular, absent, or infrequent:Amenorrhea This term refers to the absence of periods for three to six months in a woman who has previously had periods or when menstrual periods haven't started by age 15.Oligomenorrhea: This is a medical term for infrequent periods. Women with oligomenorrhea have fewer than six to eight periods in a year.See your doctor if you miss more than three menstrual periods in a row, or three menstrual periods over the course of a year.A number of conditions can cause irregular periods, including problems with the ovaries, uterus, cervix, vagina, or hormone-releasing centers in the brain.Menorrhagia is the medical term for menstrual bleeding that lasts longer than normal or is very heavy.Heavy periods can be a sign of other health problems. They also can lead to anemia (low red blood cell count, or lack of hemoglobin in the blood) from the increase in bleeding that occurs.Talk to your doctor if:By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.There’s a growing menstrual justice movement to raise awareness about, and eradicate, period poverty.What your menstrual cycle can tell you about your gynecological health.It’s time to learn the terminology and technical medical speak surrounding your monthly bleed.Don't be embarrassed that you bleed — embrace your period!

Is Your Menstrual Cycle Normal?,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/is-your-menstrual-cycle-normal.aspx,"If your menstrual cycles are irregular, your body could be trying to tell you something. Find out what's normal and what's not when it comes to your period.Some women’s menstrual cycles run like clockwork, predictably starting every four weeks and lasting around five days or so. If your period does not follow this pattern, should you be concerned? Not necessarily. ""Normal"" menstrual cycles can range from as little as 21 days to as long as 35 days, with menstrual flow at about 2 to 3 teaspoons per cycle, says Jonathan Espana, MD, an ob-gyn at the Pavilion for Women at Texas Children’s Hospital and the Women’s Specialists of Houston. But if your periods are way off that mark, your body could be trying to tell you something.""An irregular cycle is never really considered normal,"" Dr. Espana says. The exceptions are in the few years after a girl’s first period and in the years leading up to menopause. Periods can be unpredictable at those times.According to Anne Gonzalez, MD, an ob-gyn at Memorial Hermann Memorial City Medical Center in Houston, ""an occasional irregular cycle can be normal and does not necessarily warrant evaluation in a healthy woman unless it persists."" For instance, missing one period because of stress may be okay, but not having a period for three to six months is abnormal and needs medical attention, Dr. Gonzalez says. Of course, if you are sexually active, pregnancy could be the reason for your irregular cycle.There are multiple reasons why your cycle may be irregular, but the most common cause is the ovaries’ failure to release an egg every month. However, changes in diet, weight, exercise, stress, travel, and work (like going from a day shift to a night shift) can also mess with your periods, says Laura Whiteley, MD, of the Memorial Hermann Medical Group.In some cases, irregular periods may be a symptom of a bigger health issue, including:Other health problems that may trigger changes in your menstrual cycle include diabetes, cancer, drug and alcohol abuse, and HIV infection.Watch out for cycles that have been fairly predictable and then become unpredictable, Espana says. ""Having excessive bleeding, bleeding in between periods, or any other abnormality of the cycle that was not present before could be the beginning of a problem,"" he explains.You should call your doctor if:Also seek medical attention if you have any bleeding after menopause. ""Postmenopausal bleeding is not normal and should always be evaluated by a doctor,"" Gonzalez warns.""Hormonal contraception is the first-line treatment for irregular bleeding,"" Gonzalez says. Options include pills, vaginal rings, patches, devices that are implanted under the skin, and IUDs (intrauterine devices) containing hormones.If medication does not work, she adds, a procedure called endometrial ablation can be performed in women who no longer want to become pregnant. The operation removes a thin layer of the lining of the uterus and can stop menstruation completely or reduce blood flow significantly. As a last resort, hysterectomy may be necessary to solve the problem.Dr. Whiteley has this advice for women concerned about their periods: ""Do not be afraid to share your concerns with your doctor.

"Egg Freezing as Viable as 'Fresh' Eggs, Fertility Experts Say",https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/1019/egg-freezing-as-viable-as-fresh-eggs-fertility-experts-say.aspx,"Whether you plan to have children or not, a woman’s fertility is essential to the survival of the human species. And yet, many people know less than they should about the realities of conception and what it takes to preserve fertility. Research published in the journal Fertility and Sterility found that while 40 percent of the 1,000 participating women, between ages 18 and 40 in the United States, expressed concerns about their ability to conceive, one-third of them were unaware of adverse effects that sexually transmitted infections (STDs), obesity, or irregular periods could have on their ability to procreate, and 40 percent were unfamiliar with the ovulatory phase. (1)“It is still very common for women to have basic misunderstandings about fertility in terms of pregnancy/family planning,” says Toni Weschler, MPH, the author of Taking Charge of Your Fertility and Cycle Savvy. “One of the most prevalent myths about fertility is that ovulation always occurs on day 14. If this were true, there would be virtually no need for birth control, since couples could simply avoid intercourse around that one day. And scores of couples desiring to conceive would simply have intercourse on day 14, and bingo! — the woman would get pregnant.”RELATED: Getting Pregnant, Fertility, and Infertility: Need to Know Info for Women and Men Under Age 35The truth is, the timing of ovulation can vary from one woman to another, even from one cycle to the next in the same woman. But that doesn’t mean that a woman can spontaneously ovulate at any time in the cycle, as some people believe, Weschler says. “Once a woman ovulates [in a particular menstrual cycle], there are usually about two weeks before her next cycle starts with a period and it is not possible for her to ovulate again until the following cycle.”The reason: Once ovulation occurs, the hormone progesterone is secreted in the second half of the menstrual cycle, and progesterone suppresses the release of other eggs until the following cycle, Weschler says. Meanwhile, women are fertile for only a few days around ovulation, which is another thing many women don’t fully understand, so once that baby-making window has closed, it remains shut until she next ovulates.Indeed, a 2017 survey of nearly 2,100 women in the U.S. and Europe revealed that 49 percent of the U.S. women said they didn’t understand the importance of timing sexual intercourse around the fertile days of the menstrual cycle.Related: Some Fertility Apps Help Women Identify Fertility Window, Study SaysWhat’s more, 83 percent of the U.S. women said they underestimated the amount of time it would take them to get pregnant, and 72 percent admitted they had inconvenient or unromantic sex in order to try to conceive.

In research published in Human Reproduction, researchers interviewed 61 women who delivered their first child after age 40 through in vitro fertilization (IVF). They found that 30 percent of the women expected their fertility to decline gradually until menopause, around age 50, and 31 percent said they expected to get pregnant without difficulty at age 40; what’s more, 44 percent said they were “shocked” and “alarmed” to discover that their understanding of the time-frame for age-related reproductive decline was inaccurate. (3)Learn More About What Men and Women 35 and Older Must Know About Fertility, Infertility and Getting PregnantThe reality is: “Age delivers the harshest blow to fertility, causing a mild decline at age 35, a precipitous drop at age 38, and another whopping one at 40,” notes Joseph A. Hill, MD, a reproductive endocrinologist and infertility specialist, and the president of the Fertility Centers of New England in Boston. During these time spans, the majority of a woman’s chromosomally competent eggs disappear. A female is born with all the eggs she will ever have — approximately 1 to 2 million — and the number declines to 300,000 to 500,000 at puberty, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

The same is true of endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

More research needs to be done before a definitive answer can be made.

Keeping Time With Your Biological Clock,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/keeping-time-with-your-biological-clock.aspx,"Find out when your fertility is at its peak and at what age the odds of having a baby begin to get dicey.You’ve seen the photos — Hollywood celebrities proudly sporting baby bumps well into their thirties and even their forties. Such images might lead you to believe that 40 is the new 20 when it comes to women’s fertility. But in reality, your biological clock marches on every time you blow out the candles on your birthday cake. “Women at 40 may look 20, but they still have 40-year-old eggs,” says William E. Gibbons, MD, director of the Family Fertility Program at Texas Children’s Pavilion for Women and director of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at Baylor College of Medicine, both in Houston.In older women, the issue with eggs is about both quantity and quality . Women are born with all the eggs they will ever have. At birth, you have more than a million, but by the time puberty rolls around, only about 300,000 remain. Of those, just a few hundred will mature and be ovulated during your reproductive years. The rest — about a thousand a month — are simply lost in a process called atresia.The best genetically sound eggs ripen and are ovulated first. So, the cream of the crop is released during a woman’s younger years. Angela Chaudhari, MD, an obstetrician and gynecologist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, adds that as eggs age, they are more likely to have a mutation because of the aging process. In older women, these factors affect both the ability to get pregnant and the chance of miscarriage, which increases. Older moms are also more likely to give birth to babies with chromosomal issues, like Down syndrome.In women’s health, reproductive years officially begin at first menstruation and end at menopause. Dr. Gibbons says that, biologically speaking, the best time for a woman to try to conceive is between the ages of 18 and 30. The biological clock really starts ticking at age 32, when doctors can detect a decline in egg quality and, therefore, fertility, Gibbons says. Every year after 32, your chances of having a baby drop.Here’s the fertility timeline as you move into your late thirties and forties, according to Gibbons:“I do think that many women are waiting longer to get pregnant due to a variety of factors, such as marrying late and being involved in their careers,” says Dr. Chaudhari. “Fertility treatments certainly do help women who are older get pregnant, but they are not always successful.”Older women may not realize just how much their biological clock is working against them. “Too often women past the age of 40 have unrealistic expectations,” Gibbons says. “They believe that infertility treatments will be the solution.” A recent study by Yale University researchers bears that out. They found that more women age 43 and older are turning to infertility clinics under the misconception that pregnancy can be instantly achieved despite their age.According to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, assisted reproductive techniques, like in vitro fertilization (IVF), resulted in a live birth for fewer than 7 percent of 43-year-old women who used their own eggs.But getting pregnant using a donor egg can raise your chances significantly. “A 45-year-old will have the same pregnancy rate as a 25-year-old if she uses a 25 year-old egg,” Gibbons says.Still, having a baby later in life can put you at greater risk for gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, and preeclampsia, Chaudhari says. “Older women in their first pregnancy seem to have a higher rate of cesarean section as well,” she adds.If you’re prime-time baby-making age, but aren’t ready for motherhood, you do have options. One is to freeze eggs to use at a later time, a process called oocyte cryopreservation. It's an expensive option, costing as much as $25,000, plus there’s a chance that your eggs will not survive the freezing, thawing, and fertilization process. Although still a relatively new procedure, freezing eggs is no longer considered experimental by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and is expected to soon become mainstream. Still, timing is vital. “The earlier a woman chooses this option, the better chance of success,” Gibbons explains.Another possibility is embryo freezing, which is also expensive but has a higher pregnancy success rate than freezing eggs, says Chaudhari. “This, of course, requires a sperm donor or partner, which some young women may find unacceptable,” she adds.Robin Gorman Newman of Great Neck, N.Y., now 51, hit a few bumps on the road to motherhood. Newman, the founder of MotherhoodLater.com, and her husband struggled with fertility problems when they decided to start a family, when she was about 36 years old. Newman says both partners had infertility issues, but she believes her older age probably played a role. The couple decided to try IVF, but that didn’t work. “It was exhausting, and I was not comfortable with the whole process,"" she says. ""Ultimately, we pursued adoption.” Four long years after that decision, Newman and her husband finally became the proud adoptive parents of Seth, now 9 years old.Newman says being older gives her vital life experience that she uses as a mother. “I try not to sweat the small stuff, and I trust my instincts as a parent. Age is an asset, not an issue,” she says. Newman adds that she does not regret not trying to have a baby earlier in life. “I believe in fate — you get the child you are meant to have. My son is a gem — I couldn’t love a child more.”TELL US: Are you trying to have a baby over 30? Share your experiences in the comments.

How Your Menstrual Cycle Affects Your Behavior,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/how-your-menstrual-cycle-affects-your-behavior.aspx,"Feeling moody? It could be your menstrual cycle. Find out how your hormones can impact your emotional health all month long.When a task as simple as a trip to the supermarket becomes an emotional ordeal, Morgan Sheets knows that her period is just around the corner.The 29-year-old from Indianapolis says that during some months, she notices her emotions becoming more unstable in the five days or so before she is due to start menstruating.“I begin feeling like everything in my life is wrong and that I'm leading the wrong life,” says Sheets, a marketing director.“Little things like making decisions about groceries to buy or getting dressed in the morning become monumental, and I agonize over them.” Sheets says she also becomes much more sensitive and cries more easily.Sheets is just one of the many women who experience premenstrual syndrome, or PMS, a collection of unpleasant symptoms, such as anxiety and bloating, that typically occur one to two weeks before menstruation and might influence behavior through in the menstrual cycle.An estimated 85 percent of women experience at least one symptom of PMS per month, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists estimates.While PMS and its related hormonal changes are often talked about and are even the subject of endless jokes on TV sitcoms, the truth is that the hormones in a woman’s body can influence her moods and actions throughout the month.“We know hormone levels fluctuate throughout the month,” says Diana Schwarzbein, MD, an endocrinologist and author of Menopause Power. “There are going to be corresponding fluctuations in other hormones that are definitely going to affect emotions, processes of thought, and physical well-being.”Here’s what your reproductive system is doing during throughout your menstrual cycle and how hormonal changes may make you feel and act.The follicular phase of your menstrual cycle begins on the day you start your period and lasts for about 10 to 14 days. During this time, the hormone estradiol begins to rise.Follicle-stimulating hormone, or FSH, is secreted, stimulating the production of follicles in the ovaries that contain eggs.This is more likely to be your “happy” time of the month. “It may just be in contrast to the second part of the month,” says Tracey Banks, MD, an ob-gyn with Adriatica Women’s Health in McKinney, Texas. “Those two weeks are usually good compared to how you feel toward the end [of the cycle].”Sheets agrees, saying she’s much more likely to notice her bad moods than her good ones. “The times of the month when I’m energetic, happy, and inspired, I don’t spend much time dwelling on them,” she says.However, there may be a biological basis for the “happiness” of the first half of a woman’s cycle. The good feelings may stem from a more sensitive brain.Women in the follicular phase of their cycle might display greater brain activity at the thought of possibly winning money than women who were in other stages of the menstrual cycle, an experimental study published in PNAS found.The estradiol rising in the body can help to tamp down the effects of the stress hormones adrenaline and cortisol, Dr. Schwarzbein says, and that could also play a part in preserving happy moods.During a woman’s ovulatory phase, a substance called luteinizing hormone increases.This hormone prompts the release of an egg from the ovaries into the fallopian tubes for fertilization. Estradiol is present in significant quantities around the time of ovulation, and it can interact with other hormones to increase your libido.“Estradiol makes insulin more effective,” Dr. Schwarzbein says. “Then the insulin tells the body to release more testosterone, and testosterone is one of the hormones that regulate sex drive.” Some experts surmise that this may be nature’s way of encouraging women to have sex during their most fertile time.Recent studies have concluded that women are indeed more likely to display sexual behavior just before ovulating and may have a greater tolerance to pain too. You might also be more likely to buy clothes, makeup, and other items to help yourself feel more attractive, according to a recent study published in the Journal of Consumer Psychology.After ovulation, the empty follicle that once contained the egg begins to secrete the hormone progesterone to thicken the lining of the uterus and prepare it for the possible implantation of an embryo.As progesterone levels rise, you may begin to feel moodier. This happens because progesterone helps the body make cortisol, a hormone that tends to be higher in people who are stressed. If cortisol levels are already elevated because of outside factors, like a busy workweek, the progesterone can cause an excess of cortisol in the body. “If I’m already doing something to give myself high cortisol levels, by the time I get to the second half of my cycle, I’m going to be irritable,” Schwarzbein says.The “yucky” feelings that come in the days before your period might have you looking for creature comforts to feel better. The same Journal of Consumer Psychology study found that women are more likely to eat high-calorie foods during the luteal phase of their cycle. “We do find that women crave certain foods during this time,” Dr. Banks says. “However, everyone is a little different, and not everyone has the same symptoms.”Although the unpleasant symptoms of the luteal phase can be hard to deal with, Schwarzbein says you can do a great deal to shut them down by developing healthier lifestyle habits. Eating a poor diet, drinking lots of alcohol, and skimping on sleep can all disrupt the body’s hormone levels, making premenstrual symptoms much harder to deal with. “If someone is having PMS, there’s something wrong with her lifestyle habits more so than a hormone problem,” Schwarzbein says. If you’re practicing good habits and still have period-related moodiness, contact your doctor, as you could have a hormone imbalance that needs correcting.TELL US: Do you notice a change in your moods from week to week?

Is Vaginal Rejuvenation Right for You?,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/1206/is-vaginal-rejuvenation-right-for-you.aspx,"The most private of all ""extreme makeovers,"" cosmetic vaginal surgeries like vaginoplasty and labiaplasty might not be worth the possible risks.Vaginal rejuvenation and related surgeries are touted as ways to restore a woman’s most intimate area to a more youthful look and feel. But before you consider genital cosmetic surgery, know that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) is raising a red flag on these procedures.The definition of genital cosmetic surgery varies from practitioner to practitioner, but generally, it is surgery to reshape the vaginal area and tighten vaginal muscles that have become lax because of childbirth, weight fluctuations, or age. Also dubbed “designer vaginas,” vaginal rejuvenation can consist of vaginoplasty, labiaplasty, or both, involving either traditional surgical techniques or laser-based procedures.Here’s a clearer picture:Other cosmetic vaginal surgeries include:“Female genital enhancement” is the fastest growing area of cosmetic surgery, according to the International Society of Cosmetogynecology, an association of gynecologic specialists in female cosmetic medicine and surgery.But the American Society of Plastic Surgeons hasn’t tracked vaginal rejuvenation surgeries since 2006, when just 1,000 or so such surgeries were reported. That figure showed a rise in the number of procedures from 2005, but still represented a drop in the bucket compared with the almost 2 million other cosmetic surgical procedures performed that year .Among those who have such procedures, many women report that they are very happy with the results and that their sex lives improved afterward. But ACOG has some big misgivings. The group says there’s no data proving that cosmetic vaginal procedures are safe and effective. It says that vaginal rejuvenation surgeries appear to be modifications of traditional procedures that correct medical conditions like female genital cutting (female circumcision) or pelvic prolapse. Their use as cosmetic surgery is not routine or accepted, it says.According to ACOG, potential complications from these surgeries include:Cosmetic vaginal surgery comes at a price. Depending on where you live, combination labiaplasty and vaginoplasty can reach $12,000. Make sure you ask if all fees, such as anesthesia costs, are included in the price. Typically, insurance does not cover cosmetic procedures. However, financing is often available, so you can ask about different payment options at your surgeon’s office.ACOG stresses that women who are considering cosmetic vaginal surgery should first talk with their gynecologist. A physical examination may reveal a genuine medical need for surgery, or sexual dysfunction problems that can be resolved with nonsurgical strategies. The look of normal genitalia varies widely from woman to woman, according to ACOG.

'Hidden' HPV May Reactivate in Older Women,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/1213/hidden-hpv-may-reactivate-in-older-women.aspx,"It's the most common STD in America, but also one of the least understood. Here, some surprising truths about HPV — from the weird ways you can catch it to who really needs the HPV vaccine.The human papillomavirus (HPV) garnered news headlines in 2017 when close to half of American adults were found to have this sexually transmitted viral infection.Apparently, 45 percent of U.S. men ages 18 to 59 have genital HPV infections according to a study published in the June 2017 issue of JAMA Oncology. In women, the prevalence is about 40 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The study was followed by a report, published in November 2017 in the Annals of Internal Medicine, that one in nine American men is infected with oral HPV, which can lead to cancers of the head, neck, and throat.RELATED: Oral HPV Is a Growing Concern in MenNo wonder HPV is a hotbed of medical research right now: It’s extremely common, vaccine-preventable in many cases, and it plays a significant role in multiple kinds of cancer, including cervical cancer in women.But for all the buzz about HPV in the scientific community, experts worry that many people are still fuzzy on details about the virus — including how it’s transmitted, who is most at risk, and how to protect yourself from infection.“There’s so much that people don’t know or misunderstand about HPV,” says William Robinson, MD, a professor of gynecologic oncology at Tulane University in New Orleans. In the following, he and other leading experts shed some light on the most common HPV knowledge gaps.HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States: According to the CDC, 79 million Americans are currently infected with some form of HPV, and 14 million become newly infected each year.“If you’ve been sexually active, you’ve got at least a 50 percent chance of having had the virus,” says Dr. Robinson. Some data suggests that more than 80 percent of sexually active women will get HPV at some point.HPV is actually an umbrella term for more than 150 strains of related viruses, most of which are relatively harmless. About 40 of them can infect the genital areas in both men and women, and a smaller number can cause genital warts or cancer.Most of the time, you’ll never even know you’ve had HPV, because most strains (except those that cause warts) are symptomless. And in 90 percent of cases, the immune system clears the virus naturally within two years, according to the CDC. But when HPV does not go away on its own, some HPV strains can cause a variety of types of cancer.People living with HIV are more likely to have HPV infections that persist, raising their chances of developing an HPV-related cancer.RELATED: HPV: The Viral Link to CancerWhile condoms can reduce your risk of HPV infection, they can’t eliminate it entirely.“The virus can live in the scrotum and the hair-bearing areas of the genitals,” says Barbara Goff, MD, the director of gynecological oncology at the University of Washington in Seattle, so any foreplay that involves skin-to-skin genital contact can transmit the virus. So can oral and anal sex.“That’s why it’s so important for young people to get vaccinated for HPV, well before they become sexually active,” says Dr. Goff.RELATED: 8 Essential Facts About HPV VaccinesIf you learn you have HPV (this is most likely to occur after an abnormal Pap test result; most doctors don’t routinely test for HPV otherwise), don’t jump to conclusions about where you contracted the virus.“Some patients assume that their current sexual partner gave it to them,” says Robinson. “But that’s probably not the case. The women who develop cervical cancer at age 40 probably got infected shortly after [having sex] with their first sexual partner.”That’s because HPV can stay dormant for years before it starts causing the cell damage that can lead to cancer. HPV-triggered cancers can take years, or even decades, to develop.Most people who know about HPV associate it with cervical cancer, but the virus is increasingly implicated in other forms of cancer, including head and neck cancers as well as cancers of the vulva, vagina, anus, and penis. Evidence suggests that women who have had cervical cancer or precancerous changes (known as dysplasia) in the cervix are at a greater risk of HPV-related cancers in other areas of the body, says Goff.These other HPV-related cancers are still fairly rare, but their numbers are on the rise. The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2017:There are no established screening guidelines for HPV-related cancers other than cervical cancer at present, but researchers are exploring how to identify people at high risk, so that their cancers can be identified and treated early.For individuals at risk of anal cancer, the anal Pap test can be used to check for abnormal cells in the anal canal. This test is not routinely offered to heterosexual women and men, but talk to your doctor about getting one if you’re concerned about your anal cancer risk.“Smoking weakens the immune system, which can allow HPV to grow more rampantly,” says Sharyn Lewin, MD, the medical director of gynecologic oncology at Holy Name Hospital in Teaneck, New Jersey. If you want to prevent a dormant HPV infection from turning into a precancerous or cancerous growth, kick your cigarette habit today.The HPV vaccine not only provides women with nearly 100 percent protection against cervical cancers caused by HPV types 16 and 18 — which cause 70 percent of cervical cancers — but it also provides direct health benefits for men, including prevention of genital warts. And though conclusive studies have yet to be done, many researchers believe that vaccination of boys will eventually reduce rates of head and neck and other cancers as well.Gardasil 9, the HPV vaccine currently given in the United States, is approved by the FDA for use in females ages 9 to 26; males ages 9 to 21; and also for males ages 21 to 26 if they have sex with men, are transgender, or have low immune function (because of HIV, for example).The general recommendation is for all girls and boys to be vaccinated at age 11 or 12, but the vaccine can be given as early as age 9, as well as in later years if a person did not receive the vaccine at the recommended age.RELATED: Can Circumcision Prevent HPV Spread?The HPV vaccine doesn’t protect against all possible high-risk types of HPV, nor does it protect against any strains a person was exposed to before vaccination, so Pap smears are still recommended for women who have had the HPV vaccine.As of 2017, the only HPV vaccine available in the United States is Gardasil 9, which protects against HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, all of which can cause cancer, as well as types 6 and 11, which cause genital warts. Two earlier HPV vaccines, Cervarix and Gardasil, protect against fewer HPV strains.This may seem obvious, but it bears repeating: The HPV vaccine is only preventive. It doesn’t fight the virus in people who’ve already acquired it. That’s partly why it’s approved only for people in their twenties and younger; chances are that older populations have already been exposed to the HPV strains the vaccine protects against. However, researchers are currently studying the value of vaccinating women older than 26.There’s no treatment for the HPV virus, although it can go away on its own. Women who have abnormal Pap test results may be advised to wait and be retested in three to six months, have additional tests to further examine any abnormality, or have treatment to remove the abnormal cells.By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.From your smartphone to the bedroom, these sexual wellness gifts are guaranteed to turn heads and curl toes.A newly published study that wrapped up two years before the pandemic finds that young people are having less sex in the 21st century.A man’s penile microbiome could predict whether his female partner develops bacterial vaginosis, study suggests.Looking for a qualified therapist to help you with your sexual issues, but baffled about where to start?

What Happens When You Stop Taking Birth Control Pills?,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/what-happens-when-you-stop-taking-birth-control-pills.aspx,"No matter what your reason for stopping birth control, here are the steps you'll need to take for a safe and healthy transition.You’re thinking about going off the pill. Whether it’s the cost, the inconvenience of having to take a birth control pill every day, or the desire to have a baby, this decision requires some planning — not just tossing away the pack.A smart first step is to talk with your doctor before you make a change. No matter your reason for stopping birth control pills, have this conversation before you take action. If you don’t want to become pregnant, you should see your doctor to discuss other forms of contraception, and if you do want to have a baby, you should see your doctor for pre-conception counseling, says Bart D. Putterman, MD, an ob-gyn at Texas Children’s Pavilion for Women in Houston.Some women are afraid of what might happen to their bodies when they stop taking the pill, but gynecologists say you have nothing to worry about. “There are very few side effects to stopping the pill,” says Sherry Thomas, MD, a gynecologist at Los Angeles-based Mission Community Hospital. And those you may have aren’t likely to last too long. But if you were on the pill for birth control, you can get pregnant as soon as you stop taking it, she warns. “The birth control pill is out of your system in one to two days,"" Dr. Thomas says. ""If you don’t want to get pregnant, you will need another (form of contraception).”Another false concern is the idea that the longer you’ve been on the pill, the longer it will take you to get pregnant once you stop. “But that’s not the case,” says Tosha Rogers, DO, an ob-gyn in the Atlanta area.Although you won’t notice that you’ve started ovulating again, if you were taking the pill for another reason, such as to control heavy bleeding or to regulate your period, it’s highly likely that the problem will return as soon as you stop, Dr. Putterman says.Likewise, if you were taking the pill to control hot flashes, you might start having them after stopping birth control pills. If the pill helps make your skin more clear, once you stop taking it, you could start breaking out again. If getting your period makes you irritable or sad and the pill was helping keep you on an even keel, don’t be surprised if those PMS emotions return once you stop.Some women may find that their appetite increases when they stop birth control pills. On the other hand, if your birth control pills were causing you to retain water, you may lose water weight once you stop.But any minor side effects shouldn’t last more than a month or two, Thomas says. “They should level off after that.” Putterman says to keep in mind that lower-dose pills have fewer side effects while you’re on them and when you withdraw from them than higher-dose pills do.Although you can stop taking birth control pills at any time, even in the middle of the pill pack, doing so could throw your cycle off and cause bleeding to start. “Your uterus gets confused, but it’s not your period,” Thomas says. “You could bleed for two weeks and there’s no way to control it.” If you want to bypass irregular bleeding, wait to finish the pack before you stop.Another reason to finish your pack is to better judge ovulation timing if you’re stopping birth control to get pregnant — you’ll know when to expect your period and when you might be ovulating. It’s easier to date your pregnancy if you know when your last period was.Once you’re off birth control pills, pay attention to your cycle. If it doesn’t return to normal in two to three months, see your doctor.

Antibiotic Tied to Higher Risk of Miscarriage,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/antibiotic-tied-to-higher-risk-of-miscarriage.aspx,"There was no increase in the risk of birth defects among women who received clarithromycin in early pregnancy.SUNDAY, Jan. 6, 2013 (MedPage Today) — Use of the antibiotic clarithromycin (Biaxin) in the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, Danish researchers reported.In a large cohort study, women who took the drug in the first trimester were 56 percent more likely to miscarry than those who did not take the drug, according to Jon Traerup Andersen, MD, of Denmark's Copenhagen University Hospital, and colleagues.Reassuringly, there was no increase in the risk of birth defects, Andersen and colleagues reported online in PLOS ONE.The drug has been associated with both miscarriage and birth defects in animal studies, and for that reason is not recommended for use by pregnant women, the researchers noted.But since many pregnancies are unplanned and the drug is widely used, a ""substantial number"" of women might be at risk, they argued, although data are limited on the extent of that risk.To help pin down the matter, they looked at 931,504 pregnancies in Denmark — registered between Jan. 1, 1997 and March 31, 2007 — including 705,837 live births, 77,553 miscarriages, and 148,114 induced abortions.Using a national prescription database that is 97.5 percent complete, they identified 401 women who were prescribed clarithromycin during the first trimester of their pregnancy.Among those women, 40 — or 10 percent — miscarried, compared with 77,513, or 8.3 percent, in the unexposed group, they reported. Those numbers yielded an adjusted hazard ratio for miscarriage of 1.56, with a 95 percent confidence interval from 1.14 to 2.13.There were 253 live births among the women exposed to clarithromycin and 9 (3.6 percent) were diagnosed with a major malformation, compared with 24,808 (3.5 percent) among children born to unexposed mothers. The difference was not significant.When clarithromycin use in the first trimester was compared directly with other drugs, the hazard ratios were similar to that seen in the main analysis — about a 45 percent to 69 percent increase in risk.The findings ""strengthen other data"" on the risks of clarithromycin, Andersen and colleagues concluded.But they cautioned that they lacked information on why clarithromycin was prescribed, so it remains possible that the underlying disease, in some cases, led to the miscarriage rather than the drug itself.There is no data on prescribed dosages, they noted, and while they have information showing that the exposed women bought and paid for their prescriptions, there is no proof that they actually took the drug.It is also possible, Andersen and colleagues cautioned, that women getting the drug differed from unexposed women in ways that were ""causally related to the outcome,"" such as obesity, alcohol consumption, smoking and antiphospholipid syndrome.Finally, they noted, registry data is subject to misclassification and the rate of miscarriage might have been under-reported.Source: Antibiotic Tied to Higher Risk of MiscarriageBy subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.From your smartphone to the bedroom, these sexual wellness gifts are guaranteed to turn heads and curl toes.A newly published study that wrapped up two years before the pandemic finds that young people are having less sex in the 21st century.A man’s penile microbiome could predict whether his female partner develops bacterial vaginosis, study suggests.Looking for a qualified therapist to help you with your sexual issues, but baffled about where to start?

Plus: Are you at risk for breast cancer?1. Yeast Infections A yeast infection is a type of vaginitis, and 3 out of 4 women will experience at least one in their life; half of women will have more than one. Yeast infections can be passed to men, but this is rare.What it is: Yeast infections are caused by a naturally occurring fungal organism called Candida albicans. The acidic environment of the vagina helps keep the yeast from growing, but when the pH  is altered, a yeast infection can occur. Moisture and other irritation can also promote the yeast to grow, causing vaginal itching.Certain medications, antibiotics, steroids and birth control pills, stress, pregnancy, diabetes, and AIDS can kill “good bacteria,” cause changes in hormones or weaken the immune system, which all contribute to yeast infections. (See related article: 14 Embarrassing Sex Questions – Answered) Signs include:Treatment: If you’ve never had a yeast infection, your doctor can diagnose it with a pelvic exam or by taking a swab.RELATED: Bacterial vaginosis or yeast infection: How to tell the differenceFirst-time yeast infections can generally be treated with over-the-counter medications, and symptoms usually clear up within a week. It comes in cream or suppository form, and the cream can also be used to relieve outer vaginal itching.For recurrent yeast infections or hard-to-clear-up infections, your doctor will prescribe an oral antibiotic.What you can do to help prevent vaginal itching and yeast infections:2. Urinary Tract InfectionWhat it is: A UTI is a bacterial infection of your urinary system, which includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. Bacteria from your skin near the rectum or in the vagina can spread and enter through the urethra, causing a UTI. The most common UTI is in the bladder, which can be very painful.More than half of all women will develop a urinary tract infection (UTI) sometime in their lifetimes. Men can develop UTIs too, but they're more common in women because their urethra is shorter, so bacteria have a shorter distance to travel.Sexual intercourse, use of diaphragms, menopause, or a weakened immune system are common causes of UTIs. Signs include:Nausea, lower back pain and fever are some signs of a kidney infection.What you can do to help prevent it:3. Cervical CancerWhat it is: As the third most common type of reproductive organ cancer, about 12,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year. It usually develops slowly over time when normal cells in a woman's cervix become cancerous.Human papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually transmitted infection, is the most common cause of cervical cancer, but not all women who contract HPV will develop cervical cancer.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved vaccines against HPV for females between the ages of 9 and 26.HIV also can weaken the immune system’s ability to fight any infection. Cervical cancer in its earliest stages usually produces no signs, but as the cancer progresses, you might notice:For cancer that’s reached the invasive stage, the following treatments may be performed: hysterectomy, radical trachelectomy, radiation, and chemotherapy.

Should Women Worry About Low Testosterone?,https://www.everydayhealth.com/low-testosterone/guide/women/,"Despite marketing that pushes testosterone as a cure-all, women must be cautious about getting more testosterone than they need.Hear the words low testosterone (or ""low T"") and you probably think ""men's health.""But women actually need small amounts of testosterone, too, as part of the mix of hormones that keep mood, energy levels, sex drive, and bodily functions working smoothly.Product marketing around testosterone therapy argues that low T could be a reason for low sex drive in women, and that low T in women can be easily solved with hormone replacement therapy.How accurate are statements like these?Chances are, if you've taken a birth control pill, you've already taken a very small dose of a testosterone derivative, points out reproductive endocrinologist David P. Cohen, MD, chief of the section of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at the University of Chicago.""The packet information calls it progesterone, but it's really a derivative of testosterone,"" he explains.Testosterone, part of a hormone class known as androgens, originates in your ovaries and your adrenal glands.Even women whose ovaries have been removed probably make enough testosterone with their adrenal glands to meet their needs, Dr. Cohen says.So while men with low T could be facing low energy, low mood, low sex drive, and changes in sleep patterns, women don't face the same dire effects.""Low testosterone is not much of a concern for women,"" he points out.This is important to know because women can be persuaded by advertisements for testosterone creams and other products that slathering on testosterone will cure low sex drive or a ""blah"" mood.Testosterone does play a role in women, though. Healthy testosterone levels help a woman:Maintain sex drive: After menopause, women might experience a dip in their sex drive. This low sex drive could be the result of lowering testosterone levels. In some women, testosterone patches have been found to revive sex drive. Cohen cautions, however, that treating reduced libido requires more than just testosterone. Therapy and creativity could also help improve your sex life.Keep bones healthy: The correct balance of testosterone furthers and supports the growth and strength of healthy bones, while too much or too little can harm bones. Testosterone replacement after menopause could help some women maintain healthy bones.Manage pain levels: According to research in the journal Pain, women who take birth control pills and have levels of testosterone that are out of balance with levels of estrogen might have less ability to manage their pain response.Preserve cognitive health: Changes in cognition and cognitive fatigue may be related to changing hormone levels. Correcting testosterone levels might help prevent cognitive fatigue, according to research in Gynecological Endocrinology.Some women may benefit from very small amounts of testosterone, says Cohen, but the side effects of excess testosterone can be worse than the reasons you might want to try hormone replacement therapy in the first place.These side effects include male pattern hair loss, acne, male pattern hair growth (such as facial hair), changes in menstrual cycles, clitoromegaly (an abnormally enlarged clitoris), and a deepening of one's voice.Some of these changes, such as clitoromegaly and a deeper voice, could be permanent, Cohen warns.Women who use testosterone continuously also run the risk of developing lipid profiles similar to those of men, which means an increased risk for heart disease.In fact, women are more likely at risk for conditions such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), in which they might have too much testosterone (or androgens) compared with levels of other hormones, than they are for conditions such as low T.That said, Cohen says that he does prescribe very small doses of testosterone for some women if it's medically appropriate to do so, but the doses are so small that he hasn't seen a clear dose-response relationship.Dosing is very individualized, he adds, if hormone replacement therapy proves to be needed. ""You don't titrate to a specific number — you titrate to symptoms,"" he says.If you feel better, it's the right dose. If you start to see some of the side effects, such as male pattern hair loss, your doctor will stop or reduce the amount of testosterone.So, if you're wondering whether the blue mood, lack of energy, and lack of desire you're struggling with is related to low T, talk with your doctor.Don't fall for over-the-counter testosterone or ""bioidentical hormone"" product marketing and dose yourself.

"HPV Vaccines May Be Less Effective in African American Women, Researchers Find",https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/hpv-vaccines-may-be-less-effective-in-african-american-women-researchers-find.aspx,"African American women are more likely to have HPV strains that are not included in current vaccines.Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines may not work as well to protect African American women against the HPV virus and cervical cancer for a surprising reason. The commonly used vaccines don't protect against the strains of the virus that are more likely to occur in blacks.Two HPV vaccines are available in the United States, and they target certain types of HPV — including HPV 16 and HPV 18 — which cause about 70 percent of all cervical cancers. However, African American women with abnormal Pap test results are about 50 percent less likely to be infected with HPV types 16 and 18 than non-Hispanic white women, according to findings from Duke University Medical Center. The research results published in the clinical journal Cancer Causes Control.""African-American women are about 20 percent more likely to develop cervical cancer and almost twice as likely to die from the disease compared with non-Hispanic white women,"" says senior author Cathrine Hoyo, PhD, MPH, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina.""If screening rates are comparable in African-American and white women,"" asks Hoyo, then ""why are the rates of cervical cancer and mortality higher among African-American women when we have a [cervical cancer screening] program that works so well?""To explore this question further, Hoyo and her colleagues conducted the Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia Cohort Study (CINCS), funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Cancer Institute. The researchers sought to identify markers that differentiate between early and advanced cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Also called cervical dysplasia, CIN is abnormal cell growth on the surface of the cervix that, if left untreated, could develop into cervical cancer. The study included an evaluation of the HPV types associated with these precancerous cell changes in African American and white women — and found important differences.The study participants included 572 women who were 18 years of age or older living in the Southeastern United States; 280 were African American, 292 non-Hispanic white. All of the women had abnormal Pap test results that were evaluated further with colposcopy, a procedure that allows magnified examination of the cervix. Eighty-six percent (494) of the women tested HPV positive; 73 percent of these women were infected with more than one type of HPV.Hoyo and her colleagues found that the African American women were often infected with different types of HPV than those found in white women.The most commonly identified HPV types were as follows:Among women with mild cervical dysplasia, or early precancerous cells:Among women with moderate to severe cervical dysplasia, or advanced precancerous cells:The findings suggest that the currently available vaccines may not adequately protect African American women from HPV and cervical cancer.Researchers found that HPV types 16 and 18, which are the primary targets of existing vaccines, were among the HPV types most commonly found in white women but not in African American women. The results also showed that in the African American women with advanced precancerous cells, the most prevalent HPV types were the very high-risk HPVs that cause cancer.Although the results are compelling, Hoyo and her colleagues emphasize that they're preliminary. It's unclear why African American women seem less likely to be infected with HPV types 16 and 18 than non-Hispanic white women. ""We hypothesize that maybe African American women may be less susceptible to infections with [HPV] 16/18 and more susceptible to be infected with [HPV] 35/58 and other high-risk HPV types,"" says study author Adriana C. Vidal, PhD, assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke University School of Medicine. ""Other [research] suggests that maybe African Americans are not exposed to infection with [HPV] 16/18,"" adds Vidal, highlighting that, ""more studies are needed to answer this question.""""This is an important study. It suggests that the best way to diagnose, prevent and treat other cancers and diseases may be different in different patient populations,"" says Hilda Hutcherson, MD, associate dean for diversity and multicultural affairs at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City. ""It may help in our quest to decrease health disparities,"" she added. Dr. Hutcherson was not involved with the research for the study.Phase III clinical trials are underway to test a potential new HPV vaccine that would target more types of HPV than the two available HPV vaccines. However, Hoyo finds that ""the most disconcerting part of this new vaccine is it doesn't include HPV 35, 66, and 68, three of the strains of HPV African-American women are getting the most."" The benefit for African American women might still be limited.RELATED: 10 Cancer Screenings Every Woman Should Know About""We may want to rethink how we develop these vaccines,"" says Hoyo, ""given that African Americans tend to be underrepresented in clinical trials.""""African American women should participate in [these kinds] of studies so that when policies, and vaccines in this case, are made they represent all the populations,"" added Vidal.In the meantime, Hutcherson made it clear that ""African American women should continue to get the current HPV vaccine until a more comprehensive one is available.""By subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.Vaccination rates lag behind those for other childhood vaccinations.Cancers of the cervix, vagina, anus, and oral cavity have been linked to the human papillomavirus, or HPV.Here’s what you need to know if you’re considering having your children vaccinated against HPV.It’s the most common sexually transmitted infection in America.

Hair Salons Work to Cut Out Domestic Violence,https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/hair-salons-work-to-cut-out-domestic-violence-5188.aspx,"Hair salons across the country are training their workers to recognize signs of domestic abuse through CUT IT OUT, a program of the Professional Beauty Association.TUESDAY, Oct. 29, 2013 —When Michaela McCredie began cosmetology school a little over a year ago, she was in an abusive marriage, only she didn't realize it. As part of her curriculum, she took a training course on recognizing the signs of domestic violence and the message really hit home.""If I didn't start school and take that class, I would be dead by now,"" McCredie said. ""I had been in a marriage for seven years and had been verbally abused for five of them. Then it got so bad, it was no longer just verbal, but physical abuse, too. I didn't know there was a place to go for help.""McCredie received the training through CUT IT OUT, a program of the Professional Beauty Association (PBA) that teaches salon workers across the country how to recognize signs of domestic violence, including bruising on the scalp and other areas not usually seen, bald spots indicating hair has been torn or pulled out, frequent injuries, low self-esteem, isolation from family and friends, self-blame, and fear of a partner.Originally a statewide program in Alabama created by The Women's Fund of Greater Birmingham and the Alabama Coalition Against Domestic Violence, CUT IT OUT trained more than 500 Alabama salon professionals in 2002. A year later, the Grants Allocation Chair and Founder and Director of Southern Living at HOME Dianne Mooney joined forces with the National Cosmetology Association (NCA) and Clairol Professional and formed a partnership to take CUT IT OUT national in March 2003. After NCA merged with PBA in 2010, CUT IT OUT became a program of PBASalons are an ideal place for this type of training because women often establish a close relationship with their hair stylists, said Rachel Molepske, Manager of Leadership Operations and Charitable Programs at PBA.""Because salon professionals are skilled and experienced listeners who are personally interested in their clients, many women suffering from abuse feel comfortable confiding in them — even if the abused women would never tell anyone else,"" she said.Molepske also notes that since a salon is usually an all-female environment, it may be one of the few places that a battered woman is allowed to go without her abuser.The training does not, however, teach the stylists to become counselors or get personally involved in the situations. Rather, they are directed to provide resources to clients including local domestic violence organizations and the National Domestic Violence Hotline. The program also provides this information on safety cards (the size of business cards) that can be easily hidden from an abusive partner.October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month, and the campaign aims to shed light on the rampant issue of abuse toward women. On a global scale, one in three women experience sexual or physical violence in their lifetime, most likely from their intimate partner, according to a report from the World Health Organization. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found similar numbers in the United States with more than 1 in 3 women having experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime.After going through the training, McCredie sought help from her instructor Marcia Bird, a hairdresser by trade and Program Manager of Cosmetology at Raritan Valley Community College in Branchburgh, N.J., who requires her cosmetology students to take the CUT IT OUT training. They established a close relationship that helped McCredie reach out to the National Domestic Violence hotline and a local domestic violence agency. She finalized her divorce in July and lives on her own with two children, age 6 and 7. She now works as a hair dresser at LaMeche salon in Skillman, N.J., where she urges other women she thinks may be victims to seek help.""I've given out a lot of the safety cards,"" she said. ""A couple of women have come back to me and said they called the hotline.""Though CUT IT OUT does not keep records of how many salon workers they have trained, the program keeps growing, Molepske said. In the last year, training materials and posters were sent more than 10,000 salons across the country, up by nearly 1,000 from the year before. And although it is impossible to know how many women the program has helped, it is through anecdotal stories like McCredie's that those involved measure its success.""Often, we think it doesn't happen here,"" Bird said, ""but abuse can happen to anyone at any time of any race, gender, or economic background. And when people find that help and are able to move forward, it’s empowering.""Rachel Thomasian, a licensed marriage and family therapist based in Los Angeles said initiatives like CUT IT OUT are beneficial because they are at the ground level.""I think TV, social media, and new campaigns help,"" she said. ""But in all reality, women get a good chunk of information from other women. When you get the conversation going, it can spread and be helpful to exponentially more women.""McCredie echoed this sentiment.""The program changed my life,"" she said.
